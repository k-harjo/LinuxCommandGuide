                <pre><p>at - Schedule a command to run once at a particular time, examine, or delete jobs.
at command is a command-line utility that is used to schedule a command to be executed at a particular time in the future. Jobs created with at command are executed only once. The at command can be used to execute any program or mail at any time in the future. It executes commands at a particular time and accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day.

The following expressions such as noon, midnight, teatime, tomorrow, next week, next Monday, etc. could be used with at command to schedule a job. 


<s1>Syntax</s1>

      at [-V] [-q queue] [-f file] [-mldbv] TIME          # Execute commands at a specified time. 
      at [-V] [-q queue] [-f file] [-mldbv] -t time_arg   # Execute commands at a specified time. 
      at -c job [job...]
      atq [-V] [-q queue]       # List the user's pending jobs, or for the superuser; list all jobs.
      atrm [-V] job [job...]    # Delete jobs, identified by their job number.
      batch                     # Execute commands when system load levels permit.


<s1>Key</s1>

   -c    Cat the jobs listed on the command line to standard output.

   -d    Is an alias for atrm.

   -f file
         Read the job from file rather than standard input.

   -l    Is an alias for atq.

   -m    Send mail to the user when the job has completed even if there was no output.

   -q queue
         use the specified queue.
         A queue designation consists of a single letter; valid queue designations range from a to z.
         and A to Z. The a queue is the default for at and the b queue for batch.
         Queues with higher letters run with increased niceness.
         The special queue "=" is reserved for jobs which are currently running. If a job is submitted to a queue
         designated with an uppercase letter, the job is treated as if it were submitted to batch at the time of
         the job. Once the time is reached, the batch processing rules with respect to load average apply.
         If atq is given a specific queue, it will only show jobs pending in that queue.

   -t time_arg
         Submit the job to be run at the time specified by the time_arg option argument, which must have
         the same format as specified for the touch utility's -t time option argument ([[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm). 

   -v    Show the time the job will be executed before reading the job. 
         Times displayed will be in the format "Thu Feb 20 14:50:00 1997".

   -V    Print the version number to standard error.

at and batch read commands from standard input or a specified file which are to be executed at a later time.

batch executes commands when system load levels permit; in other words, when the load average drops below 0.8, or the value specified in the invocation of atd.

at allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDDYY or MM/DD/YY or DD.MM.YY or YYYY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.

For example, to run a job at 4pm three days from now: at 4pm + 3 days,
to run a job at 10:00am on July 31: at 10am Jul 31
and to run a job at 1am tomorrow: at 1am tomorrow.
The exact definition of the time specification can be found in /usr/share/doc/at-3.1.10/timespec.

For both at and batch, commands are read from standard input or the file specified with the -f option and executed. The working directory, the environment (except for the variables TERM, DISPLAY and _) and the umask are retained from the time of invocation. An at - or batch - command invoked from a su(1) shell will retain the current userid. The user will be mailed standard error and standard output from his commands, if any. Mail will be sent using the command /usr/sbin/sendmail. If at is executed from a su(1) shell, the owner of the login shell will receive the mail.
