<s1>Syntax</s1>

      lspci [options] 


<s1>Key</s1>

   Basic display modes:

   -m   Dump PCI device data in a backward-compatible machine readable form. See below for details.
   -mm  Dump PCI device data in a machine readable form for easy parsing by scripts. See below for details.
   -t   Show a tree-like diagram containing all buses, bridges, devices and connections between them.

   Display options:

   -v   Be verbose and display detailed information about all devices.
   -vv  Be very verbose and display more details. This level includes everything deemed useful.
   -vvv Be even more verbose and display everything we are able to parse, even if it doesn't
        look interesting at all (e.g., undefined memory regions).
   -k   Show kernel drivers handling each device and also kernel modules capable of handling it.
        Turned on by default when -v is given in the normal mode of output.
        (Currently works only on Linux with kernel 2.6 or newer.)
   -x   Show hexadecimal dump of the standard part of the configuration space
        (the first 64 bytes or 128 bytes for CardBus bridges).
   -xxx Show hexadecimal dump of the whole PCI configuration space.
        It is available only to root as several PCI devices crash when you try to read some parts
        of the config space (this behavior probably doesn't violate the PCI standard, but it's at
        least very stupid). However, such devices are rare, so you needn't worry much.
   -xxxx Show hexadecimal dump of the extended (4096-byte) PCI configuration space available
         on PCI-X 2.0 and PCI Express buses.
   -b   Bus-centric view. Show all IRQ numbers and addresses as seen by the cards on the
        PCI bus instead of as seen by the kernel.
   -D   Always show PCI domain numbers. By default, lspci suppresses them on machines which have only domain 0.

   Options to control resolving ID's to names:

   -n   Show PCI vendor and device codes as numbers instead of looking them up in the PCI ID list.
   -nn  Show PCI vendor and device codes as both numbers and names.
   -q   Use DNS to query the central PCI ID database if a device is not found in the local pci.ids file.
        If the DNS query succeeds, the result is cached in ~/.pciids-cache and it is recognized in
        subsequent runs even if -q is not given any more. Please use this switch inside automated scripts
        only with caution to avoid overloading the database servers.
   -qq  Same as -q, but the local cache is reset.
   -Q   Query the central database even for entries which are recognized locally.
        Use this if you suspect that the displayed entry is wrong.

   Options for selection of devices:

   -s [[[[domain]:]bus]:][slot][.[func]]
           Show only devices in the specified domain (in case your machine has several host bridges,
           they can either share a common bus number space or each of them can address a PCI domain of
           its own; domains are numbered from 0 to ffff), bus (0 to ff), slot (0 to 1f) and function (0 to 7).
           Each component of the device address can be omitted or set to "*", both meaning "any value".
           All numbers are hexadecimal. E.g., "0:" means all devices on bus 0, "0" means all
           functions of device 0 on any bus, "0.3" selects third function of device 0 on  all buses
           and ".4" shows only the fourth function of each device. 
   -d [vendor]:[device]
           Show only devices with specified vendor and device ID. Both ID's are given in hexadecimal and
           may be omitted or given as "*", both meaning "any value". 

   Other options:

   -i file
           Use file as the PCI ID list instead of /usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids. 
   -p file
           Use file as the map of PCI ID's handled by kernel modules.
           By default, lspci uses /lib/modules/kernel_version/modules.pcimap.
           Applies only to Linux systems with recent enough module tools.

   -M   Invoke bus mapping mode which performs a thorough scan of all PCI devices, including those behind
        misconfigured bridges, etc. This option gives meaningful results only with a direct hardware access
        mode, which usually requires root privileges. Please note that the bus mapper only scans PCI domain 0.
   --version
        Shows lspci version. This option should be used stand-alone. 

   PCI access options:

        The PCI utilities use the PCI library to talk to PCI devices (see pcilib(7) for details).
        You can use the following options to influence its behavior:
   -A method
        The library supports a variety of methods to access the PCI hardware.
        By default, it uses the first access method available, but you can use this option to override
        this decision. See -A help for a list of available methods and their descriptions. 
   -O param=value
        The behavior of the library is controlled by several named parameters.
        This option allows to set the value of any of the parameters.
        Use -O help for a list of known parameters and their default values.

   -H1  Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 1. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf1.)

   -H2  Use direct hardware access via Intel configuration mechanism 2. (This is a shorthand for -A intel-conf2.)

   -F file
        Instead of accessing real hardware, read the list of devices and values of their
        configuration registers from the given file produced by an earlier run of lspci -x.
        This is very useful for analysis of user-supplied bug reports, because you can display the hardware configuration
        in any way you want without disturbing the user with requests for more dumps. 

   -G   Increase debug level of the library.
Machine Readable Output
If you intend to process the output of lspci automatically, please use one of the machine-readable output formats (-m, -vm, -vmm) described in this section. All other formats are likely to change between versions of lspci. All numbers are always printed in hexadecimal. If you want to process numeric ID's instead of names, please add the -n switch.

Simple format (-m)

In the simple format, each device is described on a single line, which is formatted as parameters suitable for passing to a shell script, i.e., values separated by whitespaces, quoted and escaped if necessary. Some of the arguments are positional: slot, class, vendor name, device name, subsystem vendor name and subsystem name (the last two are empty if the device has no subsystem); the remaining arguments are option-like: -rrev Revision number. -pprogif Programming interface.

The relative order of positional arguments and options is undefined. New options can be added in future versions, but they will always have a single argument not separated from the option by any spaces, so they can be easily ignored if not recognized.

Verbose format (-vmm)

The verbose output is a sequence of records separated by blank lines. Each record describes a single device by a sequence of lines, each line containing a single 'tag: value' pair. The tag and the value are separated by a single tab character. Neither the records nor the lines within a record are in any particular order. Tags are case-sensitive.
The following tags are defined:
Slot The name of the slot where the device resides ([domain:]bus:device.function). This tag is always the first in a record.
Class Name of the class.
Vendor Name of the vendor.
Device Name of the device.
SVendor Name of the subsystem vendor (optional).
SDevice Name of the subsystem (optional).
PhySlot The physical slot where the device resides (optional, Linux only).
Rev Revision number (optional).
ProgIf Programming interface (optional).
Driver Kernel driver currently handling the device (optional, Linux only).
Module Kernel module reporting that it is capable of handling the device (optional, Linux only).
New tags can be added in future versions, so you should silently ignore any tags you don't recognize.

Backward-compatible verbose format (-vm)

In this mode, lspci tries to be perfectly compatible with its old versions. It's almost the same as the regular verbose format, but the Device tag is used for both the slot and the device name, so it occurs twice in a single record. Please avoid using this format in any new code.


Files

/usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids A list of all known PCI ID's (vendors, devices, classes and subclasses). Maintained at https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/, use the update-pciids utility to download the most recent version.
/usr/share/hwdata/pci.ids.gz If lspci is compiled with support for compression, this file is tried before pci.ids.
~/.pciids-cache All ID's found in the DNS query mode are cached in this file.


Bugs

Sometimes, lspci is not able to decode the configuration registers completely. This usually happens when not enough documentation was available to the authors. In such cases, it at least prints the <?> mark to signal that there is potentially something more to say. If you know the details, patches will be of course welcome. Access to the extended configuration space is currently supported only by the linux_sysfs back-end.
