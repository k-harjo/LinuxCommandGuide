mv is used to move one or more files or directories from one place to another in file system like UNIX.
Syntax:

mv [options(s)] [source_file_name(s)] [Destination_file_name]
Examples:
If we have a file “name = jayesh_gfg” and want to rename it to “name = geeksforgeeks”.
mv jayesh_gfg geeksforgeeks
image001


If we have a file “name = geeksforgeeks” and want to move it to location “name = /home/jayeshkumar/jkj”.
mv geeksforgeeks /home/jayeshkumar/jkj/
image002


If we have a directory “name = jkj” and want to rename it to “name = new_gfg”.
mv jkj new_gfg

nc (netcat)
Netcat is one of the most powerful networking tools, security tools, and network monitoring tools. It acts like a cat command over a network. It is even considered a Swiss army knife of networking tools. It is generally used for the following reasons:
Operation related to TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets.
Port Scanning
Port Listening
Port redirection
open Remote connections
Read/Write data across the network.
Network debugging
Network daemon testing
Simple TCP proxies
A Socks or HTTP Proxy Command for ssh

It is designed by keeping in mind that it should be a flexible “back-end” tool that can be used directly or driven by any other program.
netcat (nc) command options
It offers various options that help us in enhancing its functionality. Some commonly used options include:



Examples:
System 1
We are running `nc` command in listen mode and providing a port number.
nc -lv 1111
You can replace port number `1111` with your desired port number.
