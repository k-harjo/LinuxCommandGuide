reboot command is used to restart or reboot the system. In a Linux system administration, there comes a need to restart the server after the completion of some network and other major updates. It can be software or hardware that is being carried on the server. Rebooting is needed so that the changes that the user has made can affect the server.

Cancel your scheduled Reboot:
The previously scheduled reboot can be canceled by the system administrator by simply issuing another shutdown command with the –c option and an optional message argument.
