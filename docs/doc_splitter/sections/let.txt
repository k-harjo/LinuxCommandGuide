The `let` command in Linux is a powerful tool used for evaluating arithmetic expressions on shell variables. It supports various operators and functionalities to perform calculations and manipulate values.
Syntax:
let [expression]
Options available in `let` command
Basic arithmetic operators
The addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/) and modulus(%) operators can be used in the expression with the let command.

Examples:
let "myvar =2" "myvar1=1" "myvar2=myvar1+myvar"; echo $myvar2
let "myvar =2" "myvar1=1" "myvar2=myvar1-myvar"; echo $myvar2
let "myvar =2" "myvar1=1" "myvar2=myvar1*myvar"; echo $myvar2
let "myvar =2" "myvar1=1" "myvar2=myvar1/myvar"; echo $myvar2
let "myvar =2" "myvar1=1" "myvar2=myvar1%myvar"; echo $myvar2
