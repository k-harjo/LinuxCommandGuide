nice command in Linux helps in execution of a program/process with modified scheduling priority. It launches a process with a user-defined scheduling priority. In this, if we give a process a higher priority, then Kernel will allocate more CPU time to that process.
Examples:
To set the priority of a process
nice -10 gnome-terminal
image001

To set the negative priority for a process
image002
nice --10 gnome-terminal
