fgrep - Search file(s) for lines that match a fixed string


Syntax

      fgrep options ...

fgrep is the same as 'grep -F'

all other options are the same as grep 
It's a popular fallacy that fgrep stands for fast-grep, in fact fgrep means fixed-string grep.

fgrep implements the Ahoâ€“Corasick string matching algorithm which is very fast at matching multiple strings in the input stream/file. So if fgrep is used like this:

fgrep -f patternlist.txt largetextfile.txt

it is much faster than the grep equivalent:

grep -f patternlist.txt largetextfile.txt

Matching a single pattern with fgrep is not significantly faster than grep.
