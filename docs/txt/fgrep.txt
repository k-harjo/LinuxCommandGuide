fgrep filter is used to search for the fixed-character strings in a file. There can be multiple files also to be searched. This command is useful when you need to search for strings which contain lots of regular expression metacharacters, such as “^”, “$”, etc.  


Syntax

	fgrep [options] [ -e pattern_list] [pattern] [file] 

fgrep is the same as 'grep -F'

all other options are the same as grep 
It's a popular fallacy that fgrep stands for fast-grep, in fact fgrep means fixed-string grep.


Examples

-c option: Displaying the count of number of matches. We can find the number of lines that match the given string.  

$fgrep -c "usin.g" para 
image001

-h option: To display the matched lines. 
fgrep -h "usin.g" para 
image002
