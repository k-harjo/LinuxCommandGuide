for command in Linux is used to repeatedly execute a set of command for every element present in the list.

Syntax

      for name [in words ...]; do commands; done
For each element in words, name is set to that element, and the commands are executed.
If 'in words' is not present, the for command executes the commands once for each positional parameter that is set, as if 'in "$@"' had been specified
      for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) ; do commands ; done
Equivalent to:
     (( EXP1 ))
     while (( EXP2 )); do
      commands
      (( EXP3 ))
     done
EXP1, EXP2, and EXP3 are arithmetic expressions. If any expression is omitted, it behaves as if it evaluates to 1.


Example:

image001

image002
