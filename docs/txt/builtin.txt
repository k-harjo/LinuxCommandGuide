builtin - Run a shell builtin, passing it args, and return its exit status.


Syntax

      builtin [shell-builtin [args]]
This is useful when defining a shell function with the same name as a shell builtin, retaining the functionality of the builtin within the function.

The commands marked â€¢ in the main A-Z list are bash built-ins:
alias, bind, break, builtin, caller, command, continue, declare, echo, enable, help, jobs, let, local, logout, mapfile, printf, read, readarray, source, suspend, trap, type, ulimit, unalias, wait.
Example
A function to replace 'cd' that writes the hostname and current directory to an xterm title bar:
cd()

   {

      builtin cd "$@" && xtitle "$HOST: $PWD"

   }
This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help [b]uiltin

The return status is non-zero if shell-builtin is not a shell builtin command.
