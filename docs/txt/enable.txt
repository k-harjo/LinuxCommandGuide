enable - Enable and disable builtin shell commands.


Syntax

       enable [-a] [-dnps] [-f filename] [name â€¦]


Key

   -a   List each builtin with an indication of whether or not it is enabled.
  
   -d   Delete a builtin loaded with '-f'. 

   -f   Load the new builtin command name from shared object filename, on systems that
        support dynamic loading.

   -n   Disable the names listed, otherwise names are enabled.

   -p   Print a list of shell builtins, default if no name arguments appear.
        With no other arguments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins. 

   -s   Restrict to enable only POSIX special builtins

Disabling a builtin allows a disk command which has the same name as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even though the shell normally searches for builtins before disk commands.

If there are no options, a list of the shell builtins is displayed.
If '-s' is used with '-f', the new builtin becomes a special builtin.

The return status is zero unless a name is not a shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared object.


Examples

To use the test binary found via $PATH instead of the shell builtin version:

$ enable -n test
