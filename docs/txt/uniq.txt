uniq - Report or filter out repeated lines in a file. Reads standard input comparing adjacent lines, and writes a copy of each unique input line to the standard output. The second and succeeding copies of identical adjacent input lines are not written.


Syntax

      uniq [options]... [InputFile [OutputFile]]


Options

   -N
   -f N
   --skip-fields=N
       Skip N fields on each line before checking for uniqueness.  Fields
       are sequences of non-space non-tab characters that are separated
       from each other by at least one spaces or tabs.

   +N
   -s N
   --skip-chars=N
       Skip N characters before checking for uniqueness.  If you use both
       the field and character skipping options, fields are skipped over
       first.

   -c
   --count
       Print the number of times each line occurred along with the line.

   -i
   --ignore-case
       Ignore differences in case when comparing lines.

   -d
   --repeated
       Print only duplicate lines.

   -D
   --all-repeated
       Print all duplicate lines and only duplicate lines.  This option
       is useful mainly in conjunction with other options e.g., to ignore
       case or to compare only selected fields.  This is a GNU extension.

   -u
   --unique
       Don't output lines that are repeated in the input.
       Print only lines that are unique in the INPUT.

   -w N
   --check-chars=N
       Compare N characters on each line
       (after skipping any specified fields and characters).
       By default the entire rest of the lines are compared.

By default, uniq prints the unique lines in a sorted file, it discards all but one of identical successive input lines. so that the OUTPUT contains unique lines.

uniq will only compare lines that appear successively in the input.

Repeated lines in the input will not be detected if they are not adjacent, so it may be necessary to sort the files first.

If an InputFile of - (or nothing) is given, then uniq will read from standard input.

If no OutputFile file is specified, uniq writes to standard output.


Examples

Print the file demo.txt ommiting any duplicate lines:

$ sort demo.txt | uniq

Print only the unique numbers given the input 1, 1, 2, 3

$ printf "%s\n" 1 1 2 3 | uniq -u
2
3

Count the frequency of some words:

echo "one two three one three" | tr -cs "A-Za-z" "\n" | sort | uniq -c | sort -n -r
