unset - Remove variable or function names.


Syntax

      unset [-fv] [name]


Options

      -f    The names refer to shell Functions, and the function definition is removed.
            Readonly variables and functions can not be unset. 

      -v    Each name refers to a shell Variable (default)

The return status is zero unless a name does not exist or is readonly.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help unset
