history command in Linux provides a chronological list of previously executed commands, along with corresponding command numbers. This feature allows users to recall, reuse, and modify commands without having to retype them. The command history is stored in a file, typically ~/.bash_history for the Bash shell. 


<s1>Syntax</s1>

      history 
      history [n]
      history -c
      history -d offset
      history [-anrw] [filename]
      history -ps arg


<s1>Key</s1>

   -c   Clear the history list. This can be combined with the other
        options to replace the history list completely.

   -d offset 
        Delete the history entry at position offset. 
        offset should be specified as it appears when the history is displayed. 

   -a   Append the new history lines (history lines entered since 
        the beginning of the current Bash session) to the history file. 

   -n   Append the history lines not already read from the history file 
        to the current history list. These are lines appended to the 
        history file since the beginning of the current Bash session. 

   -r   Read the current history file and append its contents to the history list. 

   -w   Write out the current history to the history file. 

   -p   Perform history substitution on the args and display the result 
        on the standard output, without storing the results in the history list. 

   -s   The args are added to the end of the history list as a single entry.

With no options, display the command history list with line numbers. Lines listed with a * have been modified.


<s1>Examples</s1>

Combine the history command with grep for efficient searching.  
history | grep chpasswd 
<img src="img/history (1).png" width="700" height="auto" alt="Description of history">

Remove a specific command from history using the history -d option. Example: 
history -d 1996 
<img src="img/history (2).png" width="700" height="auto" alt="Description of history">

Clear the entire command history using the history -c option. Example 
history -c 
<img src="img/history (3).png" width="700" height="auto" alt="Description of history">
