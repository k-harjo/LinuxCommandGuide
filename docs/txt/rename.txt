rename - Rename files.


Syntax

      rename from to file...
rename will rename the specified files by replacing the first occurrence of from in their name by to.
The rename command is mostly used to bulk-rename a number of similarly named files, to change the name of a single file use mv.


Examples

Given the files foo1, ..., foo9, foo10, ..., foo278, the commands

$ rename foo foo0 foo?
$ rename foo foo0 foo??

will turn them into foo001, ..., foo009, foo010, ..., foo278.

Fix the extension of your .htm files so they become .html :

$ rename .htm .html *.htm

Rename all files (*) to be lowercase:

$ rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' *

Rename is NOT a bash builtin, it is available on most distributions, if you dont have it then an alternative is to use a for loop.
For example to rename a folder full of .txt files to have the extension .html

$ for i in *.txt; do mv "$i" "'basename $i .txt'.html"; done
or
$ for files in *.txt; do mv "$files" "${files%.txt}.html"; done
