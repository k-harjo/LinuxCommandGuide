fold command in Linux wraps each line in an input file to fit a specified width and prints it to the standard output. By default, it wraps lines at a maximum width of 80 columns, which is configurable. To fold input using the fold command pass a file or standard input to the command.


Syntax

      fold [options]... [FILE]...


Key

   -b
   --bytes
      Count bytes rather than columns, so that tabs, backspaces, and carriage returns
      are each counted as taking up one column, just like other characters.

   -s
   --spaces
      Break at word boundaries: the line is broken after the last blank before the maximum
      line length.  If the line contains no such blanks, the line is broken at the maximum line length as usual.

   -w WIDTH
   --width=WIDTH
      Use a maximum line length of WIDTH columns instead of 80.

By default, 'fold' breaks lines wider than 80 columns. The output is split into as many lines as necessary.

'fold' counts screen columns by default; thus, a Tab can count more than one column, Backspace decreases the column count, and CarriageReturn sets the column to zero.
