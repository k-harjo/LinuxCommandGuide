dc command in Linux is used to evaluate arithmetic expressions. It evaluates expressions in the form of a postfix expression. Entering a number pushes it into the stack and entering an operator evaluates an expression and pushes the result back into the stack. It can evaluate +, -, /, *, %, ^. Different commands can be used to manipulate stack.
