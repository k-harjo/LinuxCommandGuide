if is a command in Linux which is used to execute commands based on conditions. The ‘if COMMANDS‘ list is executed. If its status is zero, then the ‘then COMMANDS‘ list is executed. Otherwise, each ‘elif COMMANDS‘ list is executed in turn, and if its exit status is zero, the corresponding ‘then COMMANDS‘ list is executed and the if command completes. Otherwise, the ‘else COMMANDS‘ list is executed, if present. The exit status of the entire construct is the exit status of the last command executed, or zero if no condition tested true.
<s1>Syntax:</s1>
if: if COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; [ elif COMMANDS; then COMMANDS; ]... [ else COMMANDS; ] fi
