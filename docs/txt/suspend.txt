suspend - Suspend the execution of this shell until it receives a SIGCONT signal.


Syntax

      suspend [-f]


Key

   -f   Do not complain if this is a login shell; just suspend anyway.
The return status is 0 unless the shell is a login shell and -f is not supplied, or if job control is not enabled.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help suspend
