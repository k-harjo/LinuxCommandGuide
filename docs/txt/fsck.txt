fsck - Filesystem consistency check and interactive repair. Journaling file systems avoid the need to run fsck.


Syntax

      fsck [options] [filesystem] ...


Options

  --     Pass all subsequent options to filesystem-specific checker.
         All options that fsck doesn't recognize will also be passed.

  -r     Interactive mode; prompt before making any repairs.

  -s     Serial mode.

  -t fstype
         Specify the filesystem type. Do not check filesystems of any other type.

  -A     Check all filesystems listed in /etc/fstab.

  -N     Suppress normal execution; just display what would be done.

  -R     Meaningful only with -A: check all filesystems listed in /etc/fstab except the root filesystem.

  -T     Suppress printing of title.

  -V     Verbose mode.
