bind - Display current readline key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a readline function or macro, or set a readline variable.

<s1>Syntax</s1>
      bind [-m keymap] [-lpsvPSVX] 
      bind [-m keymap] [-q function] [-u function] [-r keyseq] 
      bind [-m keymap] -f filename 
      bind [-m keymap] -x keyseq:shell-command 
      bind [-m keymap] keyseq:function-name or readline-command


<s1>Options</s1>

   -m keymap    Use keymap as the keymap to be affected by the subsequent bindings.
                Acceptable keymap names are emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi,
                vi-move, vi-command, and vi-insert. vi is equivalent to vi-command;
                emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.

   -l           List the names of all readline functions.

   -p           Display readline function names and bindings in such a way that they can be re-read.

   -P           List current readline function names and bindings.

   -s           Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output in such a way that
                they can be re-read.

   -S           Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.

   -v           Display readline variable names and values in such a way that they can be re-read.

   -V           List current readline variable names and values.

   -f filename  Read key bindings from filename.

   -q function  Query about which keys invoke the named function.

   -u function  Unbind all keys bound to the named function.

   -r keyseq    Remove any current binding for keyseq.

   -x keyseq:shell-command   Cause shell-command to be executed whenever keyseq is entered.
                When shell-command is executed, the shell sets the READLINE_LINE variable to the
                contents of the readline line buffer and the READLINE_POINT variable to the current
                location of the insertion point. If the executed command changes the value of
                READLINE_LINE or READLINE_POINT, those new values will be reflected in the editing state.

   -X           List all key sequences bound to shell commands and the associated commands in a format that
                can be reused as input. 


<s1>Examples: </s1>

-m: It use KEYMAP as the keymap for the duration of this command. Here we are using vi keymapping in bash, which allows us to manipulate text on the command line as you would in vi. 
bind -m vi

-l: List all the readline function names. There are around 150 functions that are available by default in this list.
