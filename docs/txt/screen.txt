screen command in Linux provides the ability to launch and use multiple shell sessions from a single ssh session.
When a process is started with ‘screen’, the process can be detached from session & then can reattach the session at a later time. When the session is detached, the process that was originally started from the screen is still running and managed by the screen itself. The process can then re-attach the session at a later time, and the terminals are still there, the way it was left.
Syntax:
screen [-opts] [cmd [args]]
Examples:
-ls: It is used to display the currently opened screens including those running in the background. It will list all the attached as well as detached screen sessions.

screen –ls

screen --help
