yes in conjunction with head can be used to generate large test files. For example, executing

yes 123456789 | head -1000 > file.txt

results in a file with 1000 lines each consisting of 10 characters (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and newline).

Using yes results in 100% processor usage, for this reason it is rarely used other than for testing e.g. to max out a computer's CPU.
