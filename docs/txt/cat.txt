cat - Concatenate and print (display) the content of files.

The cat command is a versatile companion for various file-related operations, allowing users to view, concatenate, create, copy, merge, and manipulate file contents.  

The most basic use of ‘cat’ is to display the contents of a file on the terminal. This can be achieved by simply providing the filename as an argument.
