readonly - Mark one or more variables or functions as read-only.


Syntax

      readonly [-aApf] [name] ... 


Key

   -a   Treat each name as an array variable.
   -A   restrict the variables to associative arrays.

   -p   Print a list of all readonly names (This is the default)

   -f   Mark shell functions corresponding to the names as read-only.

The given names are marked readonly and the values of these names can not be changed by subsequent assignment.

If the -f option is given, then functions corresponding to the names are so marked.

If no arguments are given, or if '-p' is given, a list of all readonly names is printed.

The '-a' option means to treat each name as an array variable.

An argument of '--' disables further option processing.

If a variable name is followed by =word, the value of the variable is set to word.

The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, or -f is supplied with a name that is not a function.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help [r]eadonly
