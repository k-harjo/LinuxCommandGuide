comm compares two sorted files line by line and write to standard output; the lines that are common and the lines that are unique. 


Syntax

$comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2 

	As using comm, we are trying to compare two files therefore the SYNTAX: of comm command needs two filenames as arguments. 

	With no OPTION used, comm produces three-column output where first column contains lines unique to FILE1, second column contains lines unique to FILE2 and third and last column contains lines common to both the files. 

	comm command only works right if you are comparing two files which are already sorted. 

   -1   Suppress lines unique to file1

   -2   Suppress lines unique to file2

   -3   Suppress lines that appear in both files

   --check-order
        Check that the input is correctly sorted, even if all input lines are pairable 

   --nocheck-order
        Do not check that the input is correctly sorted.

   --output-delimiter=STR
        Separate columns with STR.

   --help
        Display help and exit.

   --version
        Output version information and exit


   A file name of '-' means standard input.
