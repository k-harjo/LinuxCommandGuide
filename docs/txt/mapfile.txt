mapfile also called (read array) is a command of the Bash shell used to read arrays. It reads lines from the standard input into an array variable. Also, mapfile must read from substitution (< <) and not from a pipe. Also, mapfile is faster and more convenient when compared to a read loop. It returns 1 or 0 depending on whether the command was successful or not. If no array name is not specified, the default variable MAPFILE is used as the target array variable.
Syntax: mapfile [array]
Example 1. Reading an array from a file:
$ mapfile MYFILE < example.txt
$ echo ${MYFILE[@]}
$ echo ${MYFILE[0]
<img src="img/mapfile (1).png" width="700" height="auto" alt="Description of mapfile">

Example 2. Capture the output into an array:
$ mapfile GEEKSFORGEEKS < <(printf "Item 1\nItem 2\nItem 3\n")
$ echo  ${GEEKSFORGEEKS[@]}
<img src="img/mapfile (2).png" width="700" height="auto" alt="Description of mapfile">
