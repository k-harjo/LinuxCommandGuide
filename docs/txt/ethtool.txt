ethtool is a command-line tool in Linux for managing network interface devices. It allows us to modify the parameters of the devices and query the information of those devices. 

The ethtool usually comes with any distribution of Linux. But if it’s missing, we can install it with the distro’s package manager.  


Examples

$ sudo apt-get install -y ethtool 

Then, we run the command with –version to verify the installation: 

$ sudo ethtool --version 
ethtool version 5.1  

If the version is displayed without any errors, we’ve successfully installed the ethtool in our Linux. 6 

To get the general properties of a network interface device, we simply run ethtool followed by its name:
