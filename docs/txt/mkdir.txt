mkdir - Create new folder(s), if they do not already exist.


Syntax

      mkdir [Options] folder...

      mkdir "Name with spaces"


Options

  -m MODE, --mode=MODE   Set permission mode (as in chmod), not rwxrwxrwx - umask.

       -p, --parents     No error if existing, make parent directories as needed.

       -v, --verbose     Print a message for each created directory.

mkdir creates the standard entries . (dot) for the current folder and .. (dot dot) for its parent.

The -v option is non-standard and its use in scripts is not recommended.

A folder name that includes spaces can appear in some applications as "Name%20with%20spaces" This is because 20 is the Ascii code for a space in Hex.


Examples

Create the folder 'demo':

$ mkdir -p demo
