<s1>Key</s1>

   -a, --access
          Display the file access control list.

   -d, --default
          Display the default access control list.

   -c, --omit-header
          Do not display the comment header (the first three lines of each file's output).

   -e, --all-effective
          Print all effective rights comments, even if identical to the rights defined by the ACL entry.

   -E, --no-effective
          Do not print effective rights comments.

   -s, --skip-base
          Skip files that only have the base ACL entries (owner, group, others).

   -R, --recursive
          List the ACLs of all files and directories recursively.

   -L, --logical
          Logical walk, follow symbolic links to directories.
          The default behavior is to follow symbolic link arguments, and skip symbolic links encountered in subdirectories.
          Only effective in combination with -R.

   -P, --physical
          Physical walk, do not follow symbolic links to directories.
          This also skips symbolic link arguments. Only effective in combination with -R.

   -t, --tabular
          Use an alternative tabular output format. The ACL and the default ACL are displayed side by side.
          Permissions that are ineffective due to the ACL mask entry are displayed capitalized.
          The entry tag names for the ACL_USER_OBJ and ACL_GROUP_OBJ entries are also displayed in capital letters,
          which helps in spotting those entries.

   -p, --absolute-names
          Do not strip leading slash characters ('/'). The default behavior is to strip leading slash characters.

   -n, --numeric
          List numeric user and group IDs.

   -v, --version
          Print the version of getfacl and exit.

   -h, --help
          Print help explaining the command line options.

   --     End of command line options.
          All remaining parameters are interpreted as file names, even if they start with a dash character.

   -      If the file name parameter is a single dash character, getfacl reads a list of files from standard input.


Environment variables 

If the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined, the default behavior of getfacl changes in the following ways: Unless otherwise specified, only the ACL is printed. The default ACL is only printed if the -d option is given. If no command line parameter is given, getfacl behaves as if it was invoked as "getfacl -".
