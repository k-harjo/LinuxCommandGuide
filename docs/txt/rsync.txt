rsync or remote synchronization is a software utility for Unix-Like systems that efficiently sync files and directories between two hosts or machines.

One is the source or the local-host from which the files will be synced, the other is the remote-host, on which synchronization will take place. There are basically two ways in which rsync can copy/sync data:
Copying/syncing to/from another host over any remote shell like ssh, rsh.
Copying/Syncing through rsync daemon using TCP.

Rsync is famous for its delta-transfer algorithm, in which it copies only the differences between the source files present in the local-host and the existing files in the destination or the remote host.

Syntax:
rsync [options] source [destination]

Examples:
rsync foo/
The above command will list the files and directories present in the directory foo.


rsync -avh foo/ bar/
Copy/Sync files and directory locally
