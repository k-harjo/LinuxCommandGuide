The csplit command is used to split any file into many parts as required by the user. The parts are determined by context lines. Output pieces of FILE separated by PATTERN(s) to files ‘xx00’, ‘xx01’, …, and output byte counts of each piece to standard output.  


<s1>Syntax</s1>

     csplit [options]... FILE PATTERN...
Output pieces of FILE separated by PATTERN(s) to files 'xx00', 'xx01', ..., and output byte counts of each piece to standard output. (standard input if FILE is - ).


<s1>Key</s1>

   -f PREFIX
   --prefix=PREFIX
       Use PREFIX as the output file name prefix.

   -b SUFFIX
   --suffix=SUFFIX
       Use SUFFIX as the output file name suffix.  When this option is
       specified, the suffix string must include exactly one
       'printf(3)'-style conversion specification, possibly including
       format specification flags, a field width, a precision
       specifications, or all of these kinds of modifiers.  The format
       letter must convert a binary integer argument to readable form;
       thus, only 'd', 'i', 'u', 'o', 'x', and 'X' conversions are
       allowed.  The entire SUFFIX is given (with the current output file
       number) to 'sprintf(3)' to form the file name suffixes for each of
       the individual output files in turn.  If this option is used, the
       '--digits' option is ignored.

   -n DIGITS
   --digits=DIGITS
       Use output file names containing numbers that are DIGITS digits
       long instead of the default 2.

   -k
   --keep-files
       Do not remove output files when errors are encountered.

   -z
   --elide-empty-files
       Suppress the generation of zero-length output files.  (In cases
       where the section delimiters of the input file are supposed to
       mark the first lines of each of the sections, the first output
       file will generally be a zero-length file unless you use this
       option.)  The output file sequence numbers always run
       consecutively starting from 0, even when this option is specified.

   -s
   -q
   --silent
   --quiet
       Do not print counts of output file sizes.
