cfdisk - used to create, delete, and modify partitions on a disk device. It displays or manipulates the disk partition table by providing a text-based “graphical” interface. 


Syntax

      cfdisk [ -agvz ] [ -c cylinders ] [ -h heads ]
                [ -s sectors-per-track ] [ -P opt ] [ device ]  

Options

   -a  Use an arrow cursor instead of reverse video
       for highlighting the current partition.

   -g  Do not use the geometry given by the disk driver,
       but try to guess a geometry from the partition table.

   -v  Print the version number and copyright.

   -z  Start with zeroed partition table.
       This option is useful when you want to repartition your entire disk.
       Note: this option does not zero the partition table on the disk;
             rather, it starts the program without reading the existing partition table. 
   -c cylinders

   -h heads

   -s sectors-per-track
             Override the number of cylinders, heads and sectors per track read from the BIOS.
             If your BIOS or adapter does not supply this information or if it supplies incorrect
             information, use these options to set the disk geometry values.
   -P opt
           Prints the partition table in specified formats.
           opt can be one or more of "r", "s" or "t".
           See the print command (below) for more information on the print formats. 


Examples

cfdisk /dev/sda 
image001

After running you get a prompt like this: 
image002

Choose gpt from the list. Now you will see a partition table like this: 
image003
