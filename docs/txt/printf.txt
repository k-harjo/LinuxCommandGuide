printf command in Linux is used to display the given string, number or any other format specifier on the terminal window. It works the same way as “printf” works in programming languages like C.
<s1>Syntax:</s1>
$printf [-v var] format [arguments]
<s1>Example:</s1>
$printf "%b\n" "Geeks" "for" "\nGeeks\n"

Pushd
pushd is a shell built-in command which allows us to easily manipulate the directory stack. This appends a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates the stack, making the new top of the stack the present working directory. The “d” in pushd stands for the directory as it pushes the directory path onto the stack. The directory stack increases in size after each pushd command. This stack is based on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. This command has an exit status 0 i.e, it returns success unless an invalid argument is supplied or the directory change fails.
<s1>Syntax:</s1>
pushd [directory]
Desktop becomes the present working directory and is pushed onto the stack and the list of directories is displayed. The same operations will be performed for the other commands below.
pushd ~/Templates
pushd ~/Videos
pushd ~/Downloads
pushd ~/Music
pushd ~/Downloads
<s1>Examples:</s1>

Adding a directory without changing the current directory:

pushd -n [Directory]
