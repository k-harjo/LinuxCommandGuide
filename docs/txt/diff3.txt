diff3 command is used to compare the three files line by line. It internally uses the diff command to compare. When three files are compared then the following output may come which have their own meaning: 


Syntax

	diff3 [options] MYFILE OLDFILE YOURFILE

	====  : All the files are different. 

	====1 : File 1 is different. 

	====2 : File 2 is different. 

	====3 : File 3 is different. 


Key

   -a --text
         Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even if they  do not appear to be text.

   -A --show-all
         Output all changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, surrounding all conflicts with bracket lines.

   -e --ed
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE.

   -E --show-overlap
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, bracketing conflicts. 

   -x --overlap-only
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, output only overlapping changes.

   -X
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, output only overlapping changes, bracketing them.

   -3 --easy-only
         Output unmerged changes from OLDFILE to YOURFILE into MYFILE, Output only nonoverlapping changes. 

   -m --merge
         Output merged file instead of ed script (default -A).
         Unlike piping the output from 'diff3' to 'ed', this works even for binary files and incomplete lines.

   -L LABEL --label=LABEL
         Use LABEL instead of file name.
         Use the label LABEL for the brackets output by the '-A', '-E' and '-X' options.
         This option can be given up to three times, one for each input file.
         The default labels are the names of the input files.

         Thus 'diff3 -L X -L Y -L Z -m A B C' acts like 'diff3 -m A B C', except that the
         output looks like it came from files named 'X', 'Y' and 'Z' rather than from files named 'A', 'B' and 'C'.

   -i
         Append 'w' and 'q' commands at the end of ed scripts.
         This option must be combined with one of the '-AeExX3' options, and can not be combined with '-m'.

   -T --initial-tab
         Output a tab rather than two spaces before the text of a line in normal format.

   --diff-program=PROGRAM
         Use PROGRAM to compare files.

   --strip-trailing-cr
         strip trailing carriage return on input.

   -v --version
         Output the version number of 'diff3'.

   --help
         Output this help.


Example

Let us consider three files as a.txt, b.txt and c.txt.
image001

Now if diff3 command is used over these three files then following output will come:
