sleep - Delay for a specified time, pause for an amount of time specified by the sum of the values of the command line arguments.

Syntax
      sleep [NUMBER [smhd]]...

Key:

   s  :  seconds (default)

   m  :  minutes

   h  :  hours

   d  :  days

An alternative to sleep is setting the variable TMOUT, setting TMOUT=1200 will exit the shell if nothing is typed for 20 minutes. This can be a useful security fallback to ensure you don't remain logged on to a production server for too long.
