sleep command is used to create a dummy job. A dummy job helps in delaying the execution. It takes time in seconds by default but a small suffix(s, m, h, d) can be added at the end to convert it into any other format. This command pauses the execution for an amount of time which is defined by NUMBER.

Syntax:

sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX]â€¦
