The look command in Linux shows the lines beginning with a given string. This command also uses binary search if the file is sorted. If file is not specified, the file /usr/share/dict/words is used. And then only the alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic characters is ignored.
Syntax:
look [-bdf] [-t termchar] string [file ...]

Options:
-[string]: This option is used to search for the given string in a specified file.


Examples:
look "include" Assignment.c



-f : This option is used to ignore case of alphabetic character.
look -f ab words
