nc (netcat)
Netcat is one of the most powerful networking tools, security tools, and network monitoring tools. It acts like a cat command over a network. It is even considered a Swiss army knife of networking tools. It is generally used for the following reasons:
Operation related to TCP, UDP, or UNIX-domain sockets.
Port Scanning
Port Listening
Port redirection
open Remote connections
Read/Write data across the network.
Network debugging
Network daemon testing
Simple TCP proxies
A Socks or HTTP Proxy Command for ssh

It is designed by keeping in mind that it should be a flexible “back-end” tool that can be used directly or driven by any other program.
