chattr - Change file attributes on a Linux file system.


Syntax

      chattr [ -RVf ] [ -v version ] [ mode ] files...

      The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[acdeijstuADST]


Key


   -R          Recursively change attributes of directories and their contents.

   -V          Be verbose with chattr's output and print the program version.

   -f          Suppress most error messages.

   -v version  Set the file's version/generation number.
The operator '+' causes the selected attributes to be added to the existing attributes of the files; '-' causes them to be removed; and '=' causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.

The letters 'acdeijstuADST' select the new attributes for the files:

a Append only
A No atime updates
c Compressed
d No Dump
D Synchronous directory updates
e Extent format
i Immutable
j Data journalling
s Secure deletion
S Synchronous updates
t No tail-merging
T Top of directory hierarch
u Undeletable
The following attributes are read-only, and may be listed by lsattr but not modified by chattr:

h Huge file
E Compression error
I Indexed directory
X Compression raw access
Z Compressed dirty file


Example

The chattr’ can be used to preserve some system files that are very important and needs to remain in the host PC no matter what. Also to make a directory undeletable or unmodifiable for users other than superuser, this is necessary. The common use of ‘chattr’ is as below:-  

Making the file immutable: The command here made the file named file.txt immutable, hence now no operations are possible on this file until the attributes of the file are changed again.

Opening the file only in append mode: The flag a’ is used to open the file only in append mode. Consequently, it can only be appended and the previous data can’t be modified.
