hash - Remember the full pathnames of commands specified as name arguments, so they need not be searched for on subsequent invocations.


Syntax

      hash [-r] [-p filename] [name] 


Options

      -r   Reset, causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.

      -p   Use filename as the location of name (don't search $PATH).
The commands are found by searching through the directories listed in $PATH.

If no arguments are given, information about remembered commands is printed.

The return status is zero unless a name is not found or an invalid option is supplied.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help hash
