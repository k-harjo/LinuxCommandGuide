logout - Exit a login shell.


Syntax

      logout [n]
Returns a status of n to the shell's parent.

A login shell, is your topmost shell, and is started when you log in.

When you terminate a login shell (via the commands 'exit', 'logout,' or the end of file [^D]), you are logged out completely.


Sub-Shells

A 'sub-shell' is a shell created after login, either by loading a new shell or opening a window with a graphics interface. A sub-shell usually will not accept the command 'logout' to terminate, you must use 'exit' or ^D.
When you terminate a sub-shell, you are returned to the process or shell that created it.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help logout


Example (starting from a bash shell)

$ tcsh
% # now in the tcsh shell
% exit
$ # now back in the bash shell
$ logout
