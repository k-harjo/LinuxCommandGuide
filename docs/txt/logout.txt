The logout command is a Linux/UNIX shell command that performs the task of logging out the logged-in user from the system in that session, programmatically. Logout only works in logon shells, not in the non-logon shells. The difference is as follows:
Login-Shell uses invokes the ~/.bash_profile whereas the Non-Login shell invokes the ~/.bashrc first.
Login-Shell is preferred when the system environment has multiple users.
