groupmod command is used to modify or change the existing group on Linux system. 

<s1>Syntax</s1>

      groupmod [options] GROUP 

groupmod modifies the definition of the specified GROUP by modifying the appropriate entry in the group database.


<s1>Key</s1>

   -g, --gid GID
   
       The group ID of the given GROUP will be changed to GID.
       The value of GID must be a non-negative decimal integer.
       This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used.
       Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved for system groups.

       Any files that have the old group ID and must continue to
       belong to GROUP, must have their group ID changed manually.

   -h, --help
       Display help message and exit.

   -n, --new-name NEW_GROUP
       The name of the group will be changed from GROUP to NEW_GROUP.

   -o, --non-unique
       When used with the -g option, allow to change the
       group GID to a non-unique value.

   -p, --password PASSWORD
       The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).

       Note: This option is not recommended because the
       password (or encrypted password) will be visible by
       users listing the processes.

       Make sure the password respects the system's password policy.
