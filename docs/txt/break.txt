break - Exit from a for, while, until, or select loop


Syntax

      break [n]
If n is supplied, the nth enclosing loop is exited. n must be greater than or equal to 1.

The return status is zero unless n is not greater than or equal to 1.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help break


Examples

for myloop in 1 2 3 4 5 
do 
  echo -n "$myloop"
  if [ "$myloop" -eq 3 ] 
   then 
   break # This line will break out of the loop
  fi
done
