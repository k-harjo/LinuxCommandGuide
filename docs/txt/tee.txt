tee - Redirect output to multiple files, copies standard input to standard output and also to any files given as arguments. This is useful when you want not only to send some data down a pipe, but also to save a copy.


Syntax

      tee [options]... [file]...


Options

   -a
   --append
        Append standard input to the given files rather than overwriting
        them.

   -i
   --ignore-interrupts'
        Ignore interrupt signals.


Examples

   ps -ax | tee processes.txt | more
If a file being written to does not already exist, it is created.
If a file being written to already exists, the data it previously contained is overwritten unless the '-a' option is used.

The name tee is derived from plumbing terminology: T for a T-shaped pipe splitter.
