echo command in Linux is a built-in command that allows users to display lines of text or strings that are passed as arguments. It is commonly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help echo
There is also an echo utility (man echo) , but the shell built-in version will generally take precedence.
