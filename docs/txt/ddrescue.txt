ddrescue is a tool that can be used to repair and clone disks on a Linux system. This includes hard drives, partitions, DVD discs, flash drives, or really any storage device. It performs data recovery by copying data as blocks. 
 
If ddrescue encounters errors from the data itâ€™s trying to copy, it can discard them and keep only the good data. This makes it an ideal tool when trying to recover data from a corrupted disk. In this tutorial, you will learn how to install ddrescue and use it to clone a full disk or partition,and write that data to an empty storage space.
