env - Display, set, or remove environment variables, Run a command in a modified environment.


Syntax

     env [OPTION]... [NAME=VALUE]... [COMMAND [ARGS]...]


Options

  -u NAME
  --unset=NAME
       Remove variable NAME from the environment, if it was in the environment.

  -
  -i
  --ignore-environment
       Start with an empty environment, ignoring the inherited  environment.
Arguments of the form 'VARIABLE=VALUE' set the environment variable VARIABLE to value VALUE.

VALUE can be empty ('VARIABLE='). Setting a variable to an empty value is different from unsetting it.

The first remaining argument specifies the program name to invoke; it is searched for according to the 'PATH' environment variable. Any remaining arguments are passed as arguments to that program.

If no command name is specified following the environment specifications, the resulting environment is printed. This is like specifying a command name of 'printenv'.
