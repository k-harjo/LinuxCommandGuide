usermod command or modify user is a command in Linux that is used to change the properties of a user in Linux through the command line. After creating a user we have to sometimes change their attributes like password or login directory etc. so in order to do that we use the Usermod command. The information of a user is stored in the following files:
/etc/passwd
/etc/group
/etc/shadow
/etc/login.defs
/etc/gshadow
/etc/login.defs
