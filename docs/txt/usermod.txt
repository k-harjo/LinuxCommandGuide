usermod - Modify user account information.


Syntax

      usermod [options] [user]


Options

  -c comment    Comment field.

  -d dir        Home directory.

  -e date       Account expiration date.
                date is in the format MM/DD/YYYY.
                Two-digit year fields are also accepted.
                The value is stored as the number of days since January 1, 1970.
                This option requires the use of shadow passwords.

  -f days       Permanently disable account this many days after the
                password has expired. A value of -1 disables this feature.
                This option requires the use of shadow passwords.

  -g group      Initial group name or ID number.
                If a different default group has not been specified using the -D option,

  -G groups     Supplementary groups given by name or number in a comma-separated
                list with no whitespace. The user will be removed from any groups to
                which they currently belong that are not included in groups.

  -l name       Login name. This cannot be changed while the user is logged in.

  -o            Override. Accept a nonunique uid with the -u option. (Probably a bad idea.)

  -s shell      Login shell.

  -u uid        Numerical user ID. The value must be unique unless the -o option is used.
                The default value is the smallest ID value greater than 99 and greater
                than every other uid.
