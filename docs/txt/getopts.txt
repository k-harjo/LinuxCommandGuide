getopts is a very convenient bash script utility, which helps you to conveniently and gracefully handle the passing of flags(short version), and arguments in a clean, standardized manner. Instead of having the developer manually handle the flags passed to a script, this provides a handy way of handling this when iterating through a while loop.  

It is recommended to have a basic idea of the following topics: 

	-Basic Understanding of bash script. 
	-Flags in bash. 
	-Arguments in bash.
