pwd - Print Working Directory (shell builtin)


Syntax

      pwd [-LP]


Options

      -P  : The pathname printed will not contain symbolic links.
      -L  : The pathname printed can contain symbolic links

The default action is to show the current folder as an absolute path.
All components of the path will be actual folder names - none will be symbolic links.

Some shells provide a builtin pwd command which is similar or identical to this utility.
