export - Set an environment variable. The supplied names are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands.


Syntax

      export [-fn] [name[=value]]

      export -p


Options

      -f   The names refer to shell functions; 
           otherwise the names refer to shell variables.

   value   The value of the variable is set to value.

      -n   No longer mark each name for export.

      -p   Print a list of all the names exported in this shell.
           This is also the default action if no name is given.
If no names are supplied, or if the '-p' option is given, a list of exported names is displayed.


Viewing environment variables

To view the environment variable called MYVAR run:
echo "$MYVAR"

Alternatively the env command can be used to display, set, or remove environment variables.

The return status is zero unless an invalid option is supplied, one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, or '-f' is supplied with a name that is not a shell function.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help [e]xport


Examples

Set the shell variable 'MYDEPT' equal to 'Sales' :

 MYDEPT=Sales
 echo $MYDEPT
To make the change permanent, you can export this shell variable as an environment variable:

 export MYDEPT
