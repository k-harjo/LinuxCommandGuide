eval - Evaluate several commands/arguments


Syntax

      eval [arguments]
The arguments are concatenated together into a single command, which is then read and executed, and its exit status returned as the exit status of eval.

If there are no arguments or only empty arguments, the return status is zero.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help [e]val
