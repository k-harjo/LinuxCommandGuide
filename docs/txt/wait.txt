wait - Wait for each specified process to complete and return its termination status.


Syntax

      wait [n ...]


Key

   n   A process ID or a job specification

Each n can be a process ID or a job specification; if a job specification is given, all processes in that job's pipeline are waited for.

If n is not given, all currently active child processes are waited for, and the return status is zero.

If n specifies a non-existent process or job, the return status is 127. Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the last process or job waited for.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help wait


Example

$ wait 2585
