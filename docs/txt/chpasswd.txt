chpasswd command is used to change password although passwd command can also do same. But it changes the password of one user at a time so for multiple users chpasswd is used. Below figure shows the use of passwd command. Using passwd we are changing the password of the guest user. Here first you have to enter the password of the currently signed user and then you change the password of any other user. One must have administrator privileges. 


Syntax

      chpasswd [Options...]

   -c, --crypt-method METHOD
      Use the specified method to encrypt the passwords.

       The available methods are DES, MD5, NONE, and SHA256 or SHA512 if
       your libc support these methods.

       By default, PAM is used to encrypt the passwords.

   -e, --encrypted
       Supplied passwords are in encrypted form.

   -h, --help
       Display help message and exit.

   -m, --md5
       Use MD5 encryption instead of DES when the supplied passwords are
       not encrypted.

   -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
       Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the
       configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory.

   -s, --sha-rounds ROUNDS
       Use the specified number of rounds to encrypt the passwords.

       The value 0 means that the system will choose the default number
       of rounds for the crypt method (5000).

       A minimal value of 1000 and a maximal value of 999,999,999 will
       be enforced.

       You can only use this option with the SHA256 or SHA512 crypt
       method.

       By default, the number of rounds is defined by the
       SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS and SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS variables in
       /etc/login.defs.


Example: 

$chpasswd 
user1:user1_password 
user2:user2_password 
user3:user3_password 

Note: After completion please press ctrl+d to exit from the command. As soon as ctrl + d is pressed password gets changed.

A simple text file can also be used to store username and password and then use them to change the password. 

$cat > pass.txt 
user1:user1_password 
user2:user2_password 
user3:user3_password 
 
image002

Then provide this to chpasswd command. 

$chpasswd < file_name.txt

The encryption algorithm can also be applied to the password. 

$chpasswd -c SHA512 
user1:user1_password 
user2:user2_password 
user3:user3_password
