      less [options]

      command | less [options]


Moving Commands:
Commands marked with * can be preceded by a number, N. Notes in parentheses indicate the behavior if N is given.

  e  ^E  j  ^N  CR  *  Forward  one line   (or N lines).
  y  ^Y  k  ^K  ^P  *  Backward one line   (or N lines).
  f  ^F  ^V  SPACE  *  Forward  one window (or N lines).
  b  ^B  ESC-v      *  Backward one window (or N lines).
  z                 *  Forward  one window (and set window to N).
  w                 *  Backward one window (and set window to N).
  ESC-SPACE         *  Forward  one window, but don't stop at end-of-file.
  d  ^D             *  Forward  one half-window (and set half-window to N).
  u  ^U             *  Backward one half-window (and set half-window to N).
  ESC-(  RightArrow *  Left  8 character positions (or N positions).
  ESC-)  LeftArrow  *  Right 8 character positions (or N positions).
  F                    Forward forever; like "tail -f"
                      (less +F polls every second, tail -f uses inotify, which is more efficient).
  r  ^R  ^L            Repaint screen.
  R                    Repaint screen, discarding buffered input.

  h  H                 Display this help.

Default "window" is the screen height.
Default "half-window" is half of the screen height.
Searching Commands:
  /pattern          *  Search forward for (N-th) matching line.
  ?pattern          *  Search backward for (N-th) matching line.

  N                 *  Repeat previous search in reverse direction.
  ESC-n             *  Repeat previous search, spanning files.

        ^E or *  Search multiple files (pass thru END OF FILE).
        ^F or @  Start search at FIRST file (for /) or last file (for ?).
        ^K       Highlight matches, but don't move (KEEP position).
        ^R       Don't use REGULAR EXPRESSIONS.
