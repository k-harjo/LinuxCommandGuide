less command is a Linux utility that can be used to read the contents of a text file one page (one screen) at a time. It has faster access because if a file is large, it doesn’t access the complete file, but accesses it page by page.
Syntax:
less [options] filename
The less command provides several options that modify its behavior. Here are some commonly used options:

Examples:
dmesg | less -p "fail"
The above command tells less to start at first occurrence of pattern “fail” in the file and displaying the file from that point.
Output:

Displaying line number


dmesg | less -N
The -N option displays line numbers along with the file content, allowing you to reference specific lines easily.
Output:

Checking a small file
