paste - Merge lines of files, write to standard output lines consisting of sequentially corresponding lines of each given file, separated by a TAB character.


Syntax

      paste [options]... [file]...


Options

   -s
   --serial
        Paste the lines of one file at a time rather than one line from each file.

   -d DELIM-LIST
   --delimiters DELIM-LIST
        Consecutively use the characters in DELIM-LIST instead of TAB to
        separate merged lines.
        When DELIM-LIST is exhausted, start again at its beginning.
The following special characters can also be used in DELIM-LIST:
\n newline character
\t tab character
\\ backslash character
\0 Empty string (not a null character).

Any other character preceded by a backslash is equivalent to the character itself.

Standard input is used for a file name of - or if no input files are given.


Examples

Combines the lines from two files:

$ paste file1.txt file2.txt > result.txt

List the files in the current directory in three columns:

ls | paste - - -

Combine pairs of lines from a file into single lines:

paste -s -d '\t\n' myfile

Number the lines in a file, similar to nl:

sed = myfile | paste -s -d '\t\n' - -

Create a colon-separated list of directories named bin, suitable for use in the PATH environment variable:

find / -name bin -type d | paste -s -d : -
