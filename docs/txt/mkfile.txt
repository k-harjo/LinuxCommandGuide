mkfile - Create a file.


Syntax
          mkfile [ -nv ] size[b|k|m|g] filename ...


Options

   -n     Create an empty filename.  The size is noted,  but  disk  blocks
          aren't allocated until data is written to them.

   -v     Verbose.  Report the names and sizes of created files.


mkfile creates one or more files that are suitable for use as NFS- mounted swap areas. The sticky bit is set, and the file is padded with zeroes by default. Non-root users must set the sticky bit using chmod(1).

The default size unit is bytes, but the following suffixes may be used to multiply by the given factor:
b (512), k (1024), m (1048576), and g (1073741824).

The file may be given any extension, (e.g. .jpg) but the file created will not have the correct (.jpg) header inserted.

If a client's swap file is removed and recreated, it must be re-exported before the client will be able to access it.
This action may only be done when the client is not running.


Examples:

Create a 10 MB file:
$ mkfile 10m ~/newfile.txt
Create a 10 MB 'empty' file:
$ mkfile 10m ~/newfile.txt
