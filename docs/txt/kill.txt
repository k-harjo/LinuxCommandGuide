kill - Kill a process by specifying its PID, either via a signal or forced termination.


Syntax

      kill [-s sigspec] [-n signum] [-sigspec] jobspec or pid
      kill -l [exit_status]
      kill -l [sigspec]


Key

   -l   List the signal names
   -s   Send a specific signal
   -n   Send a specific signal number
Send a signal specified by sigspec or signum to the process named by job specification jobspec or process ID pid.

sigspec is either a case-insensitive signal name such as SIGINT (with or without the SIG prefix) or a signal number; signum is a signal number.

If sigspec is not present, SIGTERM is used (Terminate).

If any arguments are supplied when '-l' is given, the names of the signals corresponding to the arguments are listed, and the return status is zero. exit_status is a number specifying a signal number or the exit status of a process terminated by a signal.

The return status is true if at least one signal was successfully sent, or false if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.

--Common Kill Signals--
Signal name	Signal value	Effect
SIGHUP		1		Hangup
SIGINT		2		Interrupt from keyboard
SIGQUIT		3		Quit
SIGABRT		6		Cancel
SIGKILL		9		Kill signal
SIGTERM		15		Termination signal - allow an orderly shutdown
SIGSTOP		17,19,23	Stop the process

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help kill or man kill


Examples

List the running process

$ ps
PID TTY TIME CMD
1293 pts/5 00:00:00 MyProgram
Then Kill it

$ kill 1293
[2]+ Terminated MyProgram
To run a command and then kill it after 5 seconds:

$ my_command & sleep 5
$ kill -0 $! && kill $!

kill is a bash built in command: $ help kill
