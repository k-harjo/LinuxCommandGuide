set command is a built-in Linux shell command that displays and sets the names and values of shell and Linux environment variables. On Unix-like operating systems, the set command functions within the Bourne shell (sh), C shell (csh), and Korn shell (ksh).

<s1>Syntax:</s1>
set [options] [arguments]
Linux set Command Options
The set command provides an extensive list of options that can be combined.
Most options have a corresponding -o flag that can be used to invoke the option. The table below lists all options and their respective alternative form using the -o flag syntax.

Linux set Command Examples
This section lists examples of the most common uses of the set command.
Using the set Command Without Options
Running the command without options or arguments outputs a list of all settings - the names and values of all shell variables and functions. Since the list is very long, you can scroll through it using the Page Up and Page Down keys.

<s1>Examples:</s1>
The following is an example of a partial set command output:
<img src="img/set (1).png" alt="Description of set">


1. Run set -x:
set -x
2. Use your favorite text editor (we use the vi editor) to create a script. We created a simple loop that allows us to see the -x option effects:
x=10
while [ $x -gt 0 ]; do
         x=$[ $x-1 ]
         echo $x
         sleep 2
done
3. Make sure to chmod the script to make it executable. This step is always mandatory before running a script. The syntax is:
chmod +x [script-name.sh]
4. Execute the script. The syntax is:
./[script-name.sh]
<img src="img/set (2).png" alt="Description of set">

The output prints one line at a time, runs it, shows the result if there is one, and moves on to the next line.
Another way to enable debugging is to place the -x flag on the shebang line of the script:
#!/bin/bash -x
