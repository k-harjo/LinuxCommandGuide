Ping
ping is used to check the network connectivity between host and server/host. The “ping” command is a powerful tool that allows users to check the status of their internet connection and diagnose network-related issues.
<s1>Syntax:</s1>
ping [options] host_or_IP_address

<s1>Example:</s1>
To check your internet connection using the ping command, open the terminal and type the following command:
Replace “www.google.com” with the desired host or IP address you want to ping. If the connection is successful, you will see a series of responses displaying the round-trip time, indicating that your internet connection is working. To stop pinging we should use ctrl+c otherwise it will keep on sending packets.
