fmt command in LINUX actually works as a formatter for simplifying and optimizing text files. Formatting of text files can also be done manually, but it can be really time-consuming when it comes to large text files, this is where fmt comes to rescue. fmt re-formats each paragraph in the file specified, writing to standard output.  


<s1>Syntax</s1>

	fmt [-WIDTH] [OPTION]... [FILE]... 


<s1>Options</s1>

   -c
   --crown-margin
       "Crown margin" mode: preserve the indentation of the first two lines within a paragraph,
       and align the left margin of each subsequent line with that of the second line.

   -t
   --tagged-paragraph
       "Tagged paragraph" mode: like crown margin mode, except that if indentation
       of the first line of a paragraph is the same as the indentation of the
       second, the first line is treated as a one-line paragraph.

   -s
   --split-only
       Split lines only.  Do not join short lines to form longer ones.
       This prevents sample lines of code, and other such "formatted" text from being unduly combined.

   -u
   --uniform-spacing
       Uniform spacing. Reduce spacing between words to one space, and spacing between sentences to two spaces.

   -WIDTH
   -w WIDTH
   --width=WIDTH
       Fill output lines up to WIDTH characters (default 75).  'fmt' initially tries to 
       make lines about 7% shorter than this, to give it room to balance line lengths. 

   -p PREFIX
   --prefix=PREFIX
       Only lines beginning with PREFIX (possibly preceded by whitespace) are subject
       to formatting. The prefix and any preceding whitespace are stripped for the
       formatting and then re-attached to each formatted output line.
       One use is to format certain kinds of program comments, while leaving the code unchanged.
'fmt' reads from the specified FILE arguments (or standard input if none are given), and writes to standard output.
