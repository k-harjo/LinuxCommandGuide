return - Cause a shell function to exit with the return value n.


Syntax

      return [n]  


Options

      n    Return value i.e. an errorlevel

If n is not supplied, the return value is the exit status of the last command executed in the function. This can also be used to terminate execution of a script being executed with the . (or source) builtin, returning either n or the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit status of the script.

The return status is false if return is used outside a function and not during the execution of a script by . or source.

return is a bash builtin command.
