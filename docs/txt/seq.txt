seq - int a sequence of numbers to standard output


Syntax

      seq [options]... [FIRST [STEP]] LAST...


Options

 -f FORMAT
 --format=FORMAT
     Print all numbers using FORMAT; default '%g'.  FORMAT must contain
     exactly one of the standarding float output formats '%e', '%f', or
     '%g'.

 -s STRING
 --separator=STRING
     Separate numbers with STRING; default is a newline.  The output
     always terminates with a newline.

 -w
 --equal-width
     Print all numbers with the same width, by padding with leading
     zeroes.  (To have other kinds of padding, use '--format').
'seq' prints the numbers from FIRST to LAST by STEP.

By default, FIRST and STEP are both 1, and each number is printed on its own line. All numbers can be reals, not just integers.


Examples:

Produce a sequence of numbers from 1 to 100

$ seq 100

You can also produce a sequence with the for command

for ((myseq=0; myseq<50; myseq++))
do
echo The sequence is ${myseq}
done
fi
