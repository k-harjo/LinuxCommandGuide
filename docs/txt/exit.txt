exit command in linux is used to exit the shell where it is currently running. It takes one more parameter as [N] and exits the shell with a return of status N. If n is not provided, then it simply returns the status of last command that is executed.

<s1>Syntax</s1>

      exit [n]

<s1>Key</s1>

   n   Set the exit status to n (default=0)

If n is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed. A trap on EXIT is executed before the shell terminates.
