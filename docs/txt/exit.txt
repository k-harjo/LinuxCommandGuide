exit - Exit from a program, shell or log out of a Unix network.


Syntax

      exit [n]

Key

   n   Set the exit status to n (default=0)
If n is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed. A trap on EXIT is executed before the shell terminates.

The exit status code can be displayed with echo $?

The shell variable SHLVL displays how deeply nested you are in the bash shell, the first session opened in a terminal will be 1 and each subsequent shell session opened will increment the number. If SHLVL is greater than 1 then exit will exit the shell, if SHLVL is = 1, then exit will logout and close the terminal.

In a subshell SHLVL does not increment, but instead you can compare $BASHPID to $$

exit is a bash built in command.
