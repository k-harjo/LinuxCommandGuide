popd - Remove the top entry from the directory stack, and cd to the new top directory.


Syntax

      popd [+N | -N] [-n]


Key

   +N   Remove the Nth directory (counting from the left of the list 
        printed by dirs), starting with zero. 

   -N   Remove the Nth directory (counting from the right of the list 
        printed by dirs), starting with zero. 

   -n   Suppress the normal change of directory when removing directories from 
        the stack, so that only the stack is manipulated. 

When no arguments are given, popd removes the top directory from the stack and performs a cd to the new top directory.

The elements are numbered from 0 starting at the first directory listed with dirs; i.e., popd is equivalent to popd +0.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help popd
