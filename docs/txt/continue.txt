continue - Resume the next iteration of an enclosing for, while, until, or select loop.


SYNTAX

      continue [n]
If n is supplied, the execution of the nth enclosing loop is resumed. n must be greater than or equal to 1. The return status is zero unless n is not greater than or equal to 1.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help continue


Examples

for myloop in 1 2 3 4 5 
do 
  if [ "$myloop" -eq 3 ] 
   then 
   continue # Skip rest of this particular loop iteration.
  fi
  echo -n "$myloop"
done
continue is a POSIX 'special' builtin
