type - Describe a command. For each name, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a command name.


Syntax

      type [-aftpP] name [name ...]


Key

   -a  Print all the places that contain an executable named name. 
This includes aliases and functions, if and only if the -p option is not also used.
The table of hashed commands is not consulted when using -a.

   -t   Print a string describing the file type which is one of:
           alias    (shell alias)
           function (shell function)
           builtin  (shell builtin)
           file     (disk file)
           keyword  (shell reserved word) 
If the name is not found, then nothing is printed, and an exit status of false is returned.

   -f  Suppress shell function lookup, as with the command builtin.

   -p  Print the path of the disk file that name would execute as a command.
       returns nothing if 'type -t name' would not return file.

   -P  Force a PATH search for each name, even if 'type -t name' would not return file.
If a command is hashed, -p and -P print the hashed value, not necessarily the file that appears first in PATH.

With no options, indicate how each name would be interpreted if used as a command name.
type returns true if all of the arguments are found, false if any are not found.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help [t]ype


Examples

 $ type -a grep
 grep is /usr/bin/grep
 
 $ type type
 type is a shell builtin

 $ type lsl
 lsl is a function
 lsl ()
 {
    ls -l $1
 }
