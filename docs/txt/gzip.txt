gzip - Compress or decompress named file(s)


Syntax

     gzip options ...


Options

   --stdout
   --to-stdout
   -c
        Write output on standard output; keep original files unchanged. 
        If there are several input files, the output consists of a sequence of independently compressed members.
        To obtain better compression, concatenate all input files before compressing them.

   --decompress
   --uncompress
   -d
        Decompress.

   --force
   -f
        Force compression or decompression even if the file has multiple links or the corresponding file
        already exists, or if the compressed data is read from or written to a terminal.
        If the input data is not in a format recognized by 'gzip', and if the option --stdout
        is also given, copy the input data without change to the standard ouput: let 'zcat' behave as 'cat'.

        If '-f' is not given, and when not running in the background, 'gzip' prompts to verify whether
        an existing file should be overwritten.

   --help
   -h
        Print a help message describing the options, then quit.

   --list
   -l
        For each compressed file, list the following fields:

          compressed size:   size of the compressed file
          uncompressed size: size of the uncompressed file
          ratio:             compression ratio (0.0% if unknown)
          uncompressed_name: name of the uncompressed file

          The uncompressed size is given as '-1' for files not in 'gzip' format.

   --license
   -L
        Display the 'gzip' license then quit.

   --no-name
   -n
        When compressing, do not save the original file name and time stamp by default.
        (The original name is always saved if the name had to be truncated.)
        When decompressing, do not restore the original file name if present
        (remove only the 'gzip' suffix from the compressed file name)
        and do not restore the original time stamp if present (copy it from the compressed file).
        This option is the default when decompressing.

   --name
   -N
        When compressing, always save the original file name and time stamp; this is the default.
        When decompressing, restore the original file name and time stamp if present.
        This option is useful on systems which have a limit on file name length or when
        the time stamp has been lost after a file transfer.

   --quiet
   -q
        Suppress all warning messages.

   --recursive
   -r
        Travel the directory structure recursively. If any of the file names specified on the command line
        are directories, 'gzip' will descend into the directory and compress all the files
        it finds there (or decompress them in the case of 'gunzip').

   --suffix SUF
   -S SUF
        Use suffix SUF instead of '.gz'.
        Any suffix can be given, but suffixes other than '.z' and '.gz' should be avoided to avoid
        confusion when files are transferred to other systems.
        A null suffix forces gunzip to try decompression on all given files regardless of suffix, as in:

          gunzip -S "" *        (*.* for MSDOS)

        Previous versions of gzip used the '.z' suffix. This was changed to avoid a conflict with 'pack'.

   --test
   -t
        Test. Check the compressed file integrity.

   --verbose
   -v
        Verbose. Display the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed.

   --version
   -V
        Version. Display the version number and compilation options, then quit.

   --fast
   --best
   -N
        Regulate the speed of compression using the specified digit N, where '-1' or '--fast'
        indicates the fastest compression method (less compression)  and '--best' or '-9' 
        indicates the slowest compression method (optimal compression).
        The default compression level is '-6' (that is, biased towards high compression at expense of speed).
'gunzip' can currently decompress files created by 'gzip', 'zip', 'compress' or 'pack'. The detection of the input format is automatic.

'gzip' is designed as a complement to 'tar', not as a replacement.
