exec command in Linux is used to execute a command from the bash itself. This command does not create a new process it just replaces the bash with the command to be executed. If the exec command is successful, it does not return to the calling process.  


<s1>Syntax</s1>

exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments]] [redirection ...] 

Note: exec command does not create a new process. When we run the exec command from the terminal, the ongoing terminal process is replaced by the command that is provided as the argument for the exec command. The exec command can be used in two modes: 

Exec with a command as an argument: In the first mode, the exec tries to execute it as a command passing the remaining arguments, if any, to that command and managing the redirections, if any 


<s1>Key</s1>

      -c   Causes command to be executed with an empty environment.

      -l   Place a dash at the beginning of the zeroth arg passed to command.
           (This is what the login program does.)

      -a   The shell passes name as the zeroth argument to command.
