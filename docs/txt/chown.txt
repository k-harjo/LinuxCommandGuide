The 'chown' command, short for “change owner,” is a powerful tool that allows users to change the owner of files and directories. This command is particularly useful in scenarios where administrators need to grant or revoke access to specific resources. In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of file ownership in Linux and delve into the usage of the chown command. 


Syntax

chown [options] new_owner[:new_group] file(s) 

Here’s a breakdown of the components: 

`chown`: The base command. 

`options`: Optional flags that modify the behavior of the `chown` command. 

`new_owner[:new_group]`: The new owner and optionally the new group. If `new_group` is omitted, only the owner is changed. 

`file(s)`: The file or files for which ownership is to be changed. 

   -c
   --changes
       Verbosely describe the action for each FILE whose ownership actually changes.

   --dereference
       Do not act on symbolic links themselves but rather on what they point to.

   -f
   --silent
   --quiet
       Do not print error messages about files whose ownership cannot be changed.
    

   -h
   --no-dereference
       Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what they point to.
       This is the default.  This mode relies on the 'lchown' system call.
       On systems that do not provide the 'lchown' system call, 'chown'
       fails when a file specified on the command line is a symbolic link.
       By default, no diagnostic is issued for symbolic links encountered
       during a recursive traversal, but see '--verbose'.

   --reference=FILE
       Use the user and group of the reference FILE instead of an explicit
       NewOwner value.

   -R
   --recursive
       Recursively change ownership of directories and their contents. 
       Take care to not run recursive chown on the root '/' directory or any other system directory.

   -v
   --verbose
       Verbosely describe the action (or non-action) taken for every FILE.
       If a symbolic link is encountered during a recursive traversal on a system without
       the 'lchown' system call, and '--no-dereference' is in effect, then issue a
       diagnostic saying neither the symbolic link nor its referent is being changed.


Examples

Using `-c` Option in `chown` to Change File Ownership 

chown -c master file1.txt

Using `-v` Option in `chown` to Change File Ownership 

chown -v master file1.txt
