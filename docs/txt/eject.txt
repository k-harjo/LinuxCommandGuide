<s1>Options</s1>

   -h --help
       Display a brief description of the command options. 
 
   -d --default
       List the default device name. 
 
   -a on|1|off|0
   --auto on|1|off|0
       Control the auto-eject mode, supported by some devices.
       When enabled, the drive automatically ejects when the device is closed. 
 
   -c slot
   --changerslot slot
       A CD slot can be selected from an ATAPI/IDE CD changer.
       The CD drive can not be in use (mounted data CD or playing a music CD) for a change request to work.
       The first slot of the changer is referred to as 0, not 1. 
 
   -t --trayclose
       Send a CD tray close command. Not all devices support this command. 
 
   -T --traytoggle
       Send a CD tray close command if it's opened, and a CD tray eject command if it's closed.
       Not all devices support this command, because it uses the above CD tray close command. 
 
   -x speed
   --cdspeed speed
       Send a CD select speed command.
       The speed argument is a number indicating the desired speed (e.g. 8 for 8X speed), or 0 for maximum data rate.
       Not all devices support this command and you can only specify speeds that the drive is capable of.
       Every time the media is changed this option is cleared. This option can be used alone, or with the -t and -c options. 
 
   -X --listspeed
       Probe the CD drive to detect the available speeds.
       The output is a list of speeds which can be used as an argument of the -x option.
       Some drives can not correctly report the speed and therefore this option does not work with them. 
 
   -n --noop
       The selected device is displayed but no action is performed. 
 
   -r --cdrom
       Eject the drive using a CDROM eject command. 
 
   -s --scsi
       Eject the drive using SCSI commands. 
 
   -f --floppy
       Eject the drive using a removable floppy disk eject command. 
 
   -q --tape
       Eject the drive using a tape drive offline command. 
 
   -p --proc
       Use /proc/mounts instead /etc/mtab. It also passes the -n option to umount(1). 
 
   -m --no-unmount
       Allow eject to work with device drivers which automatically mount removable media and therefore must be always mount()ed.
       The option tells eject to not try to unmount the given device, even if it is mounted according to
       /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts.

   -v --verbose
       Run in verbose mode; more information is displayed about what the command is doing.
   -V --version
       Display the program version and exit.
