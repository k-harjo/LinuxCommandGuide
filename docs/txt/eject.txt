Syntax

      eject -h
      eject [-vnrsfmqp] [name]
      eject [-vn] -d
      eject [-vn] -a on|off|1|0 [name]
      eject [-vn] -c slot [name]
      eject [-vn] -t [name]
      eject [-vn] -T [name]

      eject [-vn] -X [name]
      eject -V


Options

   -h --help
       Display a brief description of the command options. 
 
   -d --default
       List the default device name. 
 
   -a on|1|off|0
   --auto on|1|off|0
       Control the auto-eject mode, supported by some devices.
       When enabled, the drive automatically ejects when the device is closed. 
 
   -c slot
   --changerslot slot
       A CD slot can be selected from an ATAPI/IDE CD changer.
       The CD drive can not be in use (mounted data CD or playing a music CD) for a change request to work.
       The first slot of the changer is referred to as 0, not 1. 
 
   -t --trayclose
       Send a CD tray close command. Not all devices support this command. 
 
   -T --traytoggle
       Send a CD tray close command if it's opened, and a CD tray eject command if it's closed.
       Not all devices support this command, because it uses the above CD tray close command. 
 
   -x speed
   --cdspeed speed
       Send a CD select speed command.
       The speed argument is a number indicating the desired speed (e.g. 8 for 8X speed), or 0 for maximum data rate.
       Not all devices support this command and you can only specify speeds that the drive is capable of.
       Every time the media is changed this option is cleared. This option can be used alone, or with the -t and -c options. 
 
   -X --listspeed
       Probe the CD drive to detect the available speeds.
       The output is a list of speeds which can be used as an argument of the -x option.
       Some drives can not correctly report the speed and therefore this option does not work with them. 
 
   -n --noop
       The selected device is displayed but no action is performed. 
 
   -r --cdrom
       Eject the drive using a CDROM eject command. 
 
   -s --scsi
       Eject the drive using SCSI commands. 
 
   -f --floppy
       Eject the drive using a removable floppy disk eject command. 
 
   -q --tape
       Eject the drive using a tape drive offline command. 
 
   -p --proc
       Use /proc/mounts instead /etc/mtab. It also passes the -n option to umount(1). 
 
   -m --no-unmount
       Allow eject to work with device drivers which automatically mount removable media and therefore must be always mount()ed.
       The option tells eject to not try to unmount the given device, even if it is mounted according to
       /etc/mtab or /proc/mounts.

   -v --verbose
       Run in verbose mode; more information is displayed about what the command is doing.
   -V --version
       Display the program version and exit.
Eject allows removable media (typically a CD, floppy disk, tape, or JAZ or ZIP disk) to be ejected under software control. The command can also control some multi-disc CD changers, the auto-eject feature supported by some devices, and close the disc tray of some CD drives.

The device corresponding to <name> is ejected. The name can be a device file or mount point, either a full path or with the leading "/dev", "/media" or "/mnt" omitted. If no name is specified, the default name "cdrom" is used.

There are four different methods of ejecting, depending on whether the device is a CD, SCSI device, removable floppy, or tape. By default eject tries all four methods in order until it succeeds.

If the device is currently mounted, it is unmounted before ejecting.

All options have corresponding --long names, as listed above. The long names can be abbreviated as long as they are unique.


Exit Status

Returns 0 if operation was successful, 1 if operation failed or command syntax was not valid.


Notes

Eject only works with devices that support one or more of the four methods of ejecting. This includes most CD drives (IDE, SCSI, and proprietary), some SCSI tape drives, JAZ drives, ZIP drives (parallel port, SCSI, and IDE versions), and LS120 removable floppies. Users have also reported success with floppy drives on Sun SPARC and Apple Macintosh systems. If eject does not work, it is most likely a limitation of the kernel driver for the device and not the eject program itself.

The -r, -s, -f, and -q options allow controlling which methods are used to eject. More than one method can be specified. If none of these options are specified, it tries all four (this works fine in most cases).

Eject might not always be able to determine if the device is mounted (e.g. if it has several names). If the device name is a symbolic link, eject will follow the link and use the device that it points to.

If eject determines that the device can have multiple partitions, it will attempt to unmount all mounted partitions of the device before ejecting. If an unmount fails, the program will not attempt to eject the media.

You can eject an audio CD. Some CD drives will refuse to open the tray if the drive is empty. Some devices do not support the tray close command.

If the auto-eject feature is enabled, then the drive will always be ejected after running this command. Not all Linux kernel CD drivers support the auto-eject mode. There is no way to find out the state of the auto-eject mode.

You need appropriate privileges to access the device files. Running as root or setuid root is required to eject some devices (e.g. SCSI devices).

The heuristic used to find a device, given a name, is as follows. If the name ends in a trailing slash, it is removed (this is to support filenames generated using shell file name completion). If the name starts with '.' or '/', it tries to open it as a device file or mount point. If that fails, it tries prepending '/dev/', '/media/' ,'/mnt/', '/dev/cdroms', '/dev/rdsk/', '/dev/dsk/', and finally './' to the name, until a device file or mount point is found that can be opened. The program checks /etc/mtab for mounted devices. If that fails, it also checks /etc/fstab for mount points of currently unmounted devices.

Creating symbolic links such as /dev/cdrom or /dev/zip is recommended so that eject can determine the appropriate devices using easily remembered names.

To save typing you can create a shell alias for the eject options that work for your particular setup.


Examples

Eject the default device:

eject

Eject a device or mount point named cdrom:

eject cdrom

Eject using device name:

eject /dev/cdrom

Eject using mount point:

eject /mnt/cdrom/

Eject 4th IDE device:

eject hdd

Eject first SCSI device:

eject sda

Eject using SCSI partition name (e.g. a ZIP drive):

eject sda4

Select 5th disc on multi-disc changer:

eject -v -c4 /dev/cdrom

Turn on auto-eject on a SoundBlaster CD drive:

eject -a on /dev/sbpcd
