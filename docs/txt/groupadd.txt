groupadd command is a powerful tool that facilitates the creation of new groups effortlessly 


<s1>Syntax</s1>

      groupadd [options] group 
Creates a new group account using the values specified on the command line plus the default values from the system. The new group will be entered into the system files as needed.


<s1>Options</s1>

   -f, --force
       This option causes the command to exit with
       success status if the specified group already exists.
       When used with -g, and the specified GID already exists,
       another (unique) GID is chosen (i.e. -g is turned off). 

   -g, --gid GID
       The numerical value of the group's ID.
       This value must be unique, unless the -o option is used.
       The value must be non-negative. The default is to use the
       smallest ID value greater than 999 and greater than every
       other group. Values between 0 and 999 are typically reserved
       for system accounts. 

   -h, --help
       Display help message and exit.

   -K, --key KEY=VALUE
       Overrides /etc/login.defs defaults
       (GID_MIN, GID_MAX and others).
       Multiple -K options can be specified.

       Example: -K GID_MIN=100 -K GID_MAX=499

       Note: -K GID_MIN=10,GID_MAX=499 doesn't work yet.

   -o, --non-unique
       This option permits to add a group with a non-unique GID.

   -p, --password PASSWORD
       The encrypted password, as returned by crypt(3).
       The default is to disable the password.

       Note: This option is not recommended because the password
       (or encrypted password) will be visible by users listing the processes.

       You should make sure the password respects the system's password policy.
 
   -r, --system
       Create a system group.

       The numeric identifiers of new system groups are choosen in
       the SYS_GID_MIN-SYS_GID_MAX range, defined in login.defs,
       instead of GID_MIN-GID_MAX.
