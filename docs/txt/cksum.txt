cksum - Print CRC checksum and byte counts.

Computes a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) checksum for each given File, or standard input if none are given or for a File of -


Syntax

      cksum [Option]... [File]...
cksum prints the CRC checksum for each file along with the number of bytes in the file, and the filename unless no arguments were given.

cksum is typically used to ensure that files transferred by unreliable means (e.g., netnews) have not been corrupted, by comparing the cksum output for the received files with the cksum output for the original files (typically given in the distribution).

The CRC algorithm is specified by the POSIX.2 standard. It is not compatible with the BSD or System V sum algorithms; it is more robust.

The only options are --help and --version.
