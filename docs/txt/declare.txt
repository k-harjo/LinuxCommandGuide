declare is a builtin command of the bash shell. It is used to declare shell variables and functions, set their attributes and display their values.  


<s1>Syntax</s1>

      declare [-aAfFgiIlnrtux] [-p] [name[=value]]


<s1>Key</s1>

   -a   Each name is an array variable.

   -A   Each name is an associative array variable

   -f   Use function names only.

   -F   Inhibit the display of function definitions; 
        only the function name and attributes are printed. (implies -f)

   -g   Force variables to be created or modified at the global scope, even when declare is executed
        in a shell function. It is ignored in all other cases. 

   -i   The variable is to be treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see Shell Arithmetic)
        is performed when the variable is assigned a value.

   -I   Cause local variables to inherit the attributes (except the nameref attribute) and value
        of any existing variable with the same name at a surrounding scope.
        If there is no existing variable, the local variable is initially unset. 

   -l   When the variable is assigned a value, all upper-case characters are
        converted to lower-case. The upper-case attribute is disabled.

   -n   Give each name the nameref attribute, making it a name reference to another variable.
        That other variable is defined by the value of name.
        All references, assignments, and attribute modifications to name, except for those using
        or changing the -n attribute itself, are performed on the variable referenced by nameâ€™s value.
        The nameref attribute cannot be applied to array variables.

   -p   Display the attributes and values of each name. 
        When -p is used with name arguments, additional options, other than -f and -F, are ignored.
        When -p is supplied without name arguments, declare will display the attributes and values
        of all variables having the attributes specified by the additional options.
        If no other options are supplied with -p, declare will display the attributes and values
        of all shell variables. The -f option will restrict the display to shell functions. 

   -r   Make names readonly. 
        These names cannot then be assigned values by subsequent assignment statements 
        or unset.

   -t   Give each name the trace attribute.
        Traced functions inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps from the calling shell.
        The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.

   -u   When the variable is assigned a value, all lower-case characters are converted to upper-case.
        The lower-case attribute is disabled.

   -x   Mark each name for export to subsequent commands via the environment.
