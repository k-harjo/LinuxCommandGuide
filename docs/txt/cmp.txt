cmp - Compare two files, and if they differ, tells the first byte and line number where they differ. You can use the 'cmp' command to show the offsets and line numbers where two files differ. 'cmp' can also show all the characters that differ between the two files, side by side.


<s1>Syntax</s1>

      cmp options... FromFile [ToFile]

   Multiple single letter options (unless they take an argument) can be combined into
   a single command line word:  so '-cl' is equivalent to -c -l.

   -c
       Print the differing characters.  Display control characters as a
       '^' followed by a letter of the alphabet and precede characters
       that have the high bit set with 'M-' (which stands for "meta").

   --ignore-initial=BYTES
       Ignore any differences in the the first BYTES bytes of the input files.
       Treat files with fewer than BYTES bytes as if they are empty.

   -l
       Print the (decimal) offsets and (octal) values of all differing bytes.

   --print-chars
       Print the differing characters.  Display control characters as a
       '^' followed by a letter of the alphabet and precede characters
       that have the high bit set with 'M-' (which stands for "meta").

   --quiet
   -s
   --silent
       Do not print anything; only return an exit status indicating
       whether the files differ.

   --verbose
       Print the (decimal) offsets and (octal) values of all differing
       bytes.

   -v
   --version
       Output the version number of 'cmp'.

       The file name '-' is always the standard input.  'cmp' also uses the
       standard input if one file name is omitted.

       An exit status of 0 means no differences were found, 1 means some
       differences were found, and 2 means trouble.
