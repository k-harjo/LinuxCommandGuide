dig command stands for Domain Information Groper. It is used for retrieving information about DNS name servers. It is basically used by network administrators. It is used for verifying and troubleshooting DNS problems and to perform DNS lookups. Dig command replaces older tools such as nslookup and the host. 


Syntax

     dig [@server] [-b address] [-c class] [-f filename] [-k filename]
             [-p port#] [-t type] [-x addr] [-y name:key] [-4] [-6]
                [name] [type] [class] [queryopt...]
     dig [-h]

     dig [global-queryopt...] [query...]


Key

   -b address
         Set the source IP address of the query to address.
         This must be a valid address on one of the host's network interfaces or "0.0.0.0" or "::".
         An optional port can be specified by appending "#"

   -c class
         Over-ride the default query class (IN for internet).
         class is any valid class, such as HS for Hesiod records or CH for CHAOSNET records.

   -f filename 
         Operate in batch mode by reading a list of lookup requests to process from a file.
         The file contains a number of queries, one per line.
         Each entry in the file should be organised in the same way they would be presented
         as queries to dig using the command-line interface.

   -p port#
        Specify a non-standard port number to be queried,
        default = the standard DNS port number 53.
        This option would be used to test a name server that has been configured
        to listen for queries on a non-standard port number.

   -4   Force dig to only use IPv4 query transport.

   -6   Force dig to only use IPv6 query transport.

   -t type
        Set the query type to type, any valid query type which is supported in BIND9.
        The default query type "A", unless the -x option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup.
        A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR.

        When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, type is set to ixfr=N.
        The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since the
        serial number in the zone's SOA record was N.

   -x addr
        Reverse lookups - mapping addresses to names: addr is an IPv4 address in dotted-
        decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When this option is used, there is no need
        to provide the name, class and type arguments.
        dig automatically performs a lookup for a name like 11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets the query type
        and class to PTR and IN respectively.
        By default, IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain. To use the older RFC1886
        method using the IP6.INT domain specify the -i option.
        Bit string labels (RFC2874) are now experimental and are not attempted.

   -k filename
        Sign the DNS queries sent by dig and their responses using transaction signatures (TSIG key file).
        You can also specify the TSIG key itself on the command line using the -y option;
        name is the name of the TSIG key and key is the actual key.
        The key is a base-64 encoded string, typically generated by dnssec-keygen(8).

        Caution should be taken when using the -y option on multi-user systems as the key can be visible in the
        output from ps(1) or in the shell's history file.
        When using TSIG authentication with dig, the name server that is queried needs to know the key and
        algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done by providing appropriate key and server statements
        in named.conf.

   -h   Print a brief summary of the command-line arguments and options.
