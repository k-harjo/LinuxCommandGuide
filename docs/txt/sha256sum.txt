sha256sum - Compute and check SHA256 (256-bit) checksums.


Syntax

      sha256sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...  


Options

   -b, --binary   Read in binary mode.
   -c, --check    Read SHA256 sums from the FILEs and check them.
   -t, --text     Read in text mode (default). On a GNU system, there is no difference between binary and text mode.
   --help         Display this help and exit
   --version      Output version information and exit


The following options are useful only when verifying checksums:
   --quiet        Don't print OK for each successfully verified file.
   --status       Don't output anything, status code shows success.
   -w, --warn     Warn about improperly formatted checksum lines.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input. The sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-2. When checking, the input should be a former output of this program. The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a character indicating type ('*' for binary, ' ' for text), and name for each FILE.
