The SHA-256 algorithm is used to check the integrity of the data. The hashes generated using SHA-256 can verify the integrity and authenticity of the data. We can use an SHA-256 checksum/hash, a string of numbers and letters, to determine whether a given file is the same as the original. An extremely different checksum or hash can be produced from a small change in the data. This can be used to determine whether the file was compromised during transmission or storage, either by attackers or by other technical issues. When you have a file that must be 100% accurate, it is a very good idea to perform an SHA-256 hash comparison check. As its name suggests, an SHA-256 hash is 256 bits long.
Examples:
Step 1: We will use the sha256sum command in Linux to do this. Using the below command, you can find out more about the sha256sum command in Linux.
man sha256sum


Step 2: To calculate the checksum for a string, using the command line, use the below command.
echo -n Geeks For Geeks | sha256sum
