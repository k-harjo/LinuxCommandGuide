In Linux, some commands take a long time to run, and we wait for the complete command but for some commands, we terminate that command using the kill command after some time. What if we automate the termination of long-running commands after some time.
Linux has a timeout command-line utility by using this utility we can kill the command if it is not completed within the time limit. Now letâ€™s see the syntax of the timeout command.
Here in the place of duration mention time second or minute or hours by using the number followed by:
s for second
m for minutes
h for hours

<s1>Syntax:</s1>
timeout [OPTION] DURATION COMMAND [ARG]...
<s1>Examples:</s1>
