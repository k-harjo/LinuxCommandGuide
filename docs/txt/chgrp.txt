chgrp - Change group ownership.

'chgrp' changes the group ownership of each given File to Group (which can be either a group name or a numeric group id) or to match the same group as an existing reference file.


Syntax

      chgrp [Options]... {Group | --reference=File} File...

Key

  -c
  --changes
       Verbosely describe the action for each File whose group actually changes.

  -f
  --silent
  --quiet
       Do not print error messages about files whose group cannot be changed.

  -f
  --no-dereference
       Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what they point to.
       Only available if the 'lchown' system call is provided.

  --reference=FILE
       Use the group of the reference FILE instead of an explicit GROUP.

  -v
  --verbose
       Verbosely describe the action or non-action taken for every File.

  -R
  --recursive
       Recursively change the group ownership of directories and their
       contents.


Example

Change the group ownership of a file to 'OpsGroup':

Change the group ownership of a directory and all sub-directories to 'OpsGroup', display all the changes made:

$ chgrp -c -R OpsGroup /usr/database/
