The `chgrp` command in Linux is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory. All files in Linux belong to an owner and a group. You can set the owner by using “chown” command, and the group by the “chgrp” command. 


Syntax

chgrp [OPTION]… GROUP FILE… 
chgrp [OPTION]… –reference=RFILE FILE 


Key

  -c
  --changes
       Verbosely describe the action for each File whose group actually changes.

  -f
  --silent
  --quiet
       Do not print error messages about files whose group cannot be changed.

  -f
  --no-dereference
       Act on symbolic links themselves instead of what they point to.
       Only available if the 'lchown' system call is provided.

  --reference=FILE
       Use the group of the reference FILE instead of an explicit GROUP.

  -v
  --verbose
       Verbosely describe the action or non-action taken for every File.

  -R
  --recursive
       Recursively change the group ownership of directories and their
       contents.
