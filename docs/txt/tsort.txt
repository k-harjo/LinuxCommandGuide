'tsort' reads its input as pairs of strings, separated by blanks, indicating a partial ordering. The output is a total ordering that corresponds to the given partial ordering.
   For example

     tsort <<EOF
     a b c
     d
     e f
     b c d e
     EOF

will produce the output

     a
     b
     c
     d
     e
     f

'tsort' will detect cycles in the input and writes the first cycle
encountered to standard error. <eof a
     b
     c
     d
     e
     f
     eof will produce the output detect cycles in input and writes first cycle
encountered to standard error.
Note that for given partial ordering generally there is no unique total ordering.
