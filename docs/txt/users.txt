users - Print login names of users currently logged in, print on a single line a blank-separated list of user names of users currently logged in to the current host.


Syntax

      users [OPTION]... [FILE] 


Key

   --help     display this help and exit
   --version     output version information and exit

With no FILE argument, 'users' will by default extract the user information from the file /var/run/utmp

If a FILE argument is given, 'users' uses that file instead. A common choice is /var/log/wtmp

Each user name corresponds to a login session, so if a user has more than one login session, that user's name will appear the same number of times in the output.
