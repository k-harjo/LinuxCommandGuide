locate - Find files.


Syntax

      locate [options] pattern


Options

   -d path, --database=path
                Search databases in path.
                path must be a colon- separated list.

   -h, --help   Print a help message and exit.

   --version    Print version information and then exit.

Search database(s) of filenames and print matches. *, ?, [, and ] are treated specially; / and . are not.

Matches include all files that contain pattern, unless pattern includes metacharacters, in which case locate requires an exact match.

If locate does not work, run the command: slocate -u to rebuild the index.


Faster Searches

On modern hardware it is often faster to create and search an uncompressed index file of all filenames than to use the compressed locate database, source: Julia Evans [x]

sudo find / > database.txt
grep Alanis database.txt
