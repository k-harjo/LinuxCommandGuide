dirs command shell builtin is used to display the list of currently remembered directories. By default, it includes the directory you are currently in. A directory can get into the list via pushd command followed by the dir name and can be removed via popd command. SYNTAX:dirs [-clpv] [+N] [-N] 


<s1>Syntax</s1>

	dirs [-clpv] [+N] [-N]


<s1>Options</s1>

     +N   Displays the Nth directory (counting from the left of the list 
          printed by dirs when invoked without options), starting with 
          zero. 

     -N   Displays the Nth directory (counting from the right of the list 
          printed by dirs when invoked without options), starting with 
          zero.  

     -c   Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the elements. 

     -l   Produces a longer listing; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote 
          the home directory.

     -p   Causes dirs to print the directory stack with one entry per 
          line. 
     -v   Causes dirs to print the directory stack with one entry per 
          line, prefixing each entry with its index in the stack.
