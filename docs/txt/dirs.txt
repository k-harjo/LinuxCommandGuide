dirs - Display the list of currently remembered directories.


Syntax

      dirs [+N | -N] [-clpv]


Options

     +N   Displays the Nth directory (counting from the left of the list 
          printed by dirs when invoked without options), starting with 
          zero. 

     -N   Displays the Nth directory (counting from the right of the list 
          printed by dirs when invoked without options), starting with 
          zero.  

     -c   Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the elements. 

     -l   Produces a longer listing; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote 
          the home directory.

     -p   Causes dirs to print the directory stack with one entry per 
          line. 
     -v   Causes dirs to print the directory stack with one entry per 
          line, prefixing each entry with its index in the stack.
Equivalent to 'ls -C -b'; that is,by default files are listed in columns, sorted vertically, and special characters are represented by backslash escape sequences.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help dirs
