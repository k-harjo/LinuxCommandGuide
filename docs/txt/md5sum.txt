md5sum - Compute and check MD5 message digest.


Syntax

      md5sum [OPTION]... [FILE]...  


Options

   -b
   --binary    Read in binary mode.

   -c
   --check     Read checksums from the FILEs and check them.

   --tag       Create a BSD-style checksum.

   -t
   --text      Read in text mode (default).

   -z
   --zero      End each output line with NUL, not newline, and disable
               file name escaping.

   The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:

   --ignore-missing
               Don't fail or report status for missing files.

   --quiet     Don't print OK for each successfully verified file.

   --status    Don't output anything, status code shows success.

   --strict    Exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines.

   -w
   --warn      Warn about improperly formatted checksum lines.

   --help      Display help and exit.

   --version   Output version information and exit.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

The sums are computed as described in RFC 1321. When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.

The default mode is to print a line with: checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.

There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU systems.

Do not use the MD5 algorithm for security related purposes. Instead, use an SHA-2 algorithm, implemented in the programs sha224sum(1), sha256sum, sha384sum(1), sha512sum(1), or the BLAKE2 algorithm, implemented in b2sum(1).
