dircolors - Color setup for 'ls', outputs a sequence of shell commands to set up the terminal for color output from 'ls' (and 'dir', etc.).


<s1>Syntax</s1>

      eval 'dircolors [options]... [file]'
If FILE is specified, 'dircolors' reads it to determine which colors to use for which file types and extensions. Otherwise, a precompiled
database is used. For details on the format of these files, run 'dircolors --print-database'.

The output is a shell command to set the 'LS_COLORS' environment variable. You can specify the shell syntax to use on the command line, or 'dircolors' will guess it from the value of the 'SHELL' environment variable.


<s1>Options </s1>

 -b
 --sh
 --bourne-shell
     Output Bourne shell commands.  This is the default if the 'SHELL'
     environment variable is set and does not end with 'csh' or 'tcsh'.

 -c 
 --csh
 --c-shell
     Output C shell commands.  This is the default if 'SHELL' ends with
     'csh' or 'tcsh'.

 -p
 --print-database
     Print the (compiled-in) default color configuration database.  This
     output is itself a valid configuration file, and is fairly
     descriptive of the possibilities.
