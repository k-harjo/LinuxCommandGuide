The `cp` command is a versatile tool used in Unix-like operating systems for copying files and directories. It offers three principal modes of operation, each serving different purposes.


Syntax

      cp [options]... Source Dest
      cp [options]... Source... Directory


Key

  -a, --archive                same as -dpR

  -b, --backup                 Make backup before removal.
                               If the copy will overwrite a file in the destination, then
                               the original file will be backed up as 'filename~' before
                               being overwritten.

  -d, --no-dereference         preserve links

  -f, --force                  remove existing destinations, never prompt

  -i, --interactive            prompt before overwrite

  -l, --link                   link files instead of copying

  -p, --preserve               preserve file attributes if possible

  -P, --parents                append source path to DIRECTORY

  -r                           copy recursively, non-directories as files

      --sparse=WHEN            control creation of sparse files

  -R, --recursive              copy directories recursively

  -s, --symbolic-link          make symbolic links instead of copying

  -S, --suffix=SUFFIX          override the usual backup suffix

  -u, --update                 copy only when the SOURCE file is newer
                                 than the destination file or when the
                                 destination file is missing

  -v, --verbose                explain what is being done

  -V, --version-control=WORD   override the usual version control

  -x, --one-file-system        stay on this file system
      --help                   display this help and exit
      --version                output version information and exit.


Examples

Copying Between Two Files in Linux: 

Initially, there is only one file (`a.txt`) in the directory. 

The `cp` command is used to copy the contents of `a.txt` to `b.txt`. 

After the command execution, both `a.txt` and the newly created `b.txt` coexist in the directory. 

cp a.txt b.txt 
image001

Copy files to a Directory in Linux 

cp a.txt b.txt c.txt new/ 
image002

How to Copy Directories in Linux 

cp -R Src_directory Dest_directory
