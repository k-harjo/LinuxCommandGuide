head command prints the top N number of data of the given input.  

By default, it prints the first 10 lines of the specified files. If more than one file name is provided then data from each file is preceded by its file name.   


<s1>Syntax</s1>

      head [-n count] [options] [file ...]

      head [-c bytes] [options] [file ...]


<s1>Key</s1>

  -count
     Return the first count of lines from the file. (must be the first option specified).
This option is only recognized if it is specified first. Count is a decimal number optionally followed by a size letter ('b', 'k',
'm' for bytes, Kilobytes or Megabytes) , or 'l' to mean count by lines, or other option letters ('cqv').

  -c bytes
  --bytes=bytes
       Print the first bytes bytes, instead of initial lines. 
       Appending 'b' multiplies bytes by 512, 'k' by 1024, and 'm' by 1048576.

  -n count
  --lines=count
       Output the first count lines.

  -q
  --quiet
  --silent
       Never print file name headers.

  -v
  --verbose
       Always print file name headers.

If no files are given (or if given a file of '-') head will read from standard input.

If more than one file is specified, 'head' will print a one-line header consisting of ==> FILE NAME <== before the output for each file.

Two option formats are accepted: the new one, in which numbers are arguments to the options ('-q -n 1'), and the old one, in which the number precedes any option letters ('-1q')
