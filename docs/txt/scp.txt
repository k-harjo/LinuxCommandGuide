For example: If we want to copy a file name “test.txt” from local system to a
“remoteuser” = “Jayesh”
“remotehost” = “10.143.90.2”

How to Securely copy a file from remote machine to our local machine.

scp user@remotehost:/home/user/file_name
here
“user” = username of remote system.
“remotehost” = IP address (or hostname) of remote system.
“/home/user/file_name” = path of file that has to be copied.
“.” = this means that we are copying that file in current location in local system.

If we have
“user” = jayesh
“remotehost” = 10.143.90.2
“home/user/file_name” = home/jayesh/test1.txt

scp jayesh@10.143.90.2:/home/jayesh/test1.txt
