sdiff command in linux is used to compare two files and then writes the results to standard output in a side-by-side format.
It displays each line of the two files with a series of spaces between them if the lines are identical. It displays greater than sign if the line only exists in the file specified by the File2 parameter, and a | (vertical bar) for lines that are different.
