false - Do nothing, returning a non-zero (false) exit status.


Syntax

      false
'false' does nothing except return an exit status of 1, meaning "failure". It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where an unsuccessful command is needed.

'false' ignores all command line arguments, even --help and --version, since to do otherwise would change expected behavior that some programmers might be relying on.

This version of 'false' is implemented as a C program, and is thus more secure and faster than a shell script implementation, and can safely be used as a dummy shell for the purpose of disabling accounts.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help false
