unexpand - Convert spaces to tabs, write the contents of each given FILE, or standard input if none are given or for a FILE of '-', to standard output. Strings of two or more space or tab characters are converted to as many tabs as possible followed by as many spaces as are needed.


<s1>Syntax</s1>

      unexpand [options]... [file]...


<s1>Options</s1>

   -a
   --all
      Convert all strings of two or more spaces or tabs,
      not just initial ones, to tabs.

   -TAB1[,TAB2]...
   -t TAB1[,TAB2]...
   --tabs=TAB1[,TAB2]...
      If only one tab stop is given, set the tabs TAB1 spaces apart instead of the default 8.
      Otherwise, set the tabs at columns TAB1, TAB2, ... (numbered from 0),
      and leave spaces and tabs beyond the tabstops given unchanged.
      If the tabstops are specified with the '-t' or '--tabs' option,
      they can be separated by blanks as well as by commas.
      This option implies the '-a' option.
By default, 'unexpand' converts only initial spaces and tabs (those that precede all non space or tab characters) on each line.
It preserves backspace characters in the output; they decrement the column count for tab calculations.
By default, tabs are set at every 8th column.
