dirname - Convert a full pathname to just a path.


Syntax
     dirname pathname
Prints all but the final slash-delimited component of a string (presumably a filename).
If PATHNAME is a single component, dirname prints . (meaning the current directory)

Examples
Extract the path from the variable pathnamevar and store in the variable result using parameter expansion $( )

$ result=$(dirname "$pathnamevar")


*See
hash - Remember the full pathname of a name argument.

which - Show full path of commands.
