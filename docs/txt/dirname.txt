dirname is a command in Linux that is used to remove the trailing forward slashes “/” from the NAME and prints the remaining portion. If the argument NAME does not contain the forward slash “/” then it simply prints dot “.”. In other words, we can say that the `dirname` command is a useful tool for extracting the directory portion from a given path or filename.   


Syntax
