Paste
paste is used to join files horizontally (parallel merging) by outputting lines consisting of lines from each file specified, separated by tab as delimiter, to the standard output
<s1>Syntax:</s1>
paste [OPTION]... [FILES]â€¦

<s1>Examples:</s1>
-s (serial): We can merge the files in sequentially manner using the -s option. It reads all the lines from a single file and merges all these lines into a single line with each line separated by tab. And these single lines are separated by newline.

After that newline character is introduced and reading from next file i.e. state starts and process repeats again till all files are read. Combination of -d and -s: The following example shows how to specify a delimiter for sequential merging of files:
