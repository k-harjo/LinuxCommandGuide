split - Split a file into fixed-size pieces, creates output files containing consecutive sections of INPUT
(standard input if none is given or INPUT is '-')


Syntax

      split [options] [INPUT [PREFIX]]


Options

 -LINES
 -l LINES
 --lines=LINES
     Put LINES lines of INPUT into each output file.

 -b BYTES
 --bytes=BYTES
     Put the first BYTES bytes of INPUT into each output file.
     Appending 'b' multiplies BYTES by 512, 'k' by 1024, and 'm' by
     1048576.

 -C BYTES
 --line-bytes=BYTES
     Put into each output file as many complete lines of INPUT as
     possible without exceeding BYTES bytes.  For lines longer than
     BYTES bytes, put BYTES bytes into each output file until less than
     BYTES bytes of the line are left, then continue normally.  BYTES
     has the same format as for the '--bytes' option.

 --verbose
     Write a diagnostic to standard error just before each output file
     is opened.


By default, 'split' puts 1000 lines of INPUT (or whatever is left over for the last section), into each output file.

The output files' names consist of PREFIX ('x' by default) followed by a group of letters 'aa', 'ab', and so on, such that concatenating the output files in sorted order by file name produces the original input file.

If more than 676 output files are required, 'split' uses 'zaa', 'zab', etc.


Examples

Split up the file demo.zip into multiple 100 MB files:

$ split -b 100m demo.zip

The output files will be named with 3 letters starting xaa, xab, â€¦ to reassemble them, cat the files in alphabetical order:

$ cat 'ls x*' > demo2.zip
