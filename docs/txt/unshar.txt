unshar - Unpack shell archive scripts. Each file is processed in turn, as a shell archive or a collection of shell archives. If no files are given, then standard input is processed instead.


Syntax

      unshar [options] ... [file... ]


Options

   -d DIRECTORY
   --directory=DIRECTORY
       Change directory to DIRECTORY before unpacking any files.

   -c
   --overwrite
   -f
   --force
       Passed as an option to the shar file.  Many shell archive scripts
       (including those produced by 'shar' 3.40 and newer) accepts a '-c'
       argument to indicate that existing files should be overwritten.

       The option '-f' is provided for a more unique interface. Many programs
       (such as 'cp' and 'mv') use this option to trigger the  very same action.

   -e
   --exit-0
       This option exists mainly for people who collect many shell archives
       into a single mail folder.  With this option, 'unshar' isolates each
       different shell archive from the others which have been put in the
       same file, unpacking each in turn, from the beginning of the file
       towards its end.  Its proper operation relies on the fact that
       many shar files are terminated by a 'exit 0' at the beginning of a line.

       Option '-e' is internally equivalent to '-E "exit 0"'.

   -E STRING
   --split-at=STRING
       This option works like '-e', but it allows you to specify the string that
       separates archives if 'exit 0' isn't appropriate.
 
       For example, noticing that most '.signatures' have a '--' on a line right
       before them, one can sometimes use '--split-at=--' for splitting shell
       archives which lack the 'exit 0' line at end.  The signature will then be
       skipped altogether with the headers of the following message.

   --version
       Print the version number of the program on standard output, then
       immediately exits.

   --help
       Print a help summary on standard output, then immediately exits.
