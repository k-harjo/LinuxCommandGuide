du command - Used to track the files and directories which are consuming excessive amount of space on hard disk drive 

Suppose there are two files say kt.txt and pt.txt and you want to know the disk usage of these files, then you can simply use du command by specifying the file names along with it.


Syntax

      du [options]... [file]...
      
      du [OPTION]... --files0-from=F


Options

   -a
   --all
      Show counts for all files, not just directories.

   -b
   --bytes
      Print sizes in bytes, overriding the default block size.

   -c
   --total
      Print a grand total of all arguments after all arguments have been processed.
      This can be used to find out the total disk usage of a given set of files or directories.
     

   -D
   --dereference-args
      Dereference symbolic links that are command line arguments. Does not affect other symbolic links. 
      This helps to find the disk usage of directories, such as '/usr/tmp', which are often symbolic links.

   -h
   --human-readable
      Append a size letter such as 'M' for megabytes to each size.
      Powers of 1024 are used, not 1000; 'M' stands for 1,048,576 bytes.
      Use the '-H' or '--si' option if you prefer powers of 1000.

   -H
   --si
      Display size with a non-standard suffix as follows:
      B=Byte, K=kilobyte, M=megabyte, G=gigabyte, T=teraByte and P=petabyte.

      Powers of 1000 are used, not 1024; so 'M' stands for 1,000,000 bytes.
      Use the '-h' or '--human-readable' option if you prefer powers of 1024.

   -k
   --kilobytes
      Print sizes in 1024-byte blocks, overriding the default block size.

   -l
   --count-links
      Count the size of all files, even if they have appeared already (as a hard link).

   -L
   --dereference
      Dereference symbolic links (show the disk space used by the file or directory that
      the link points to instead of the space used by the link).

   --max-depth=MAX_DEPTH
      Show the total for each directory (and file if -all) that is at most MAX_DEPTH levels
      down from the root of the hierarchy.  The root is at level 0, so 'du --max-depth=0'
      is equivalent to 'du -s'.

   -m
   --megabytes
      Print sizes in megabyte (that is, 1,048,576-byte) blocks.

   -s
   --summarize
      Display only a total for each argument.

   -S
   --separate-dirs
      Report the size of each directory separately, not including the sizes of subdirectories.

   -x
   --one-file-system
      Skip directories that are on different filesystems from the one that the argument being processed is on.

   --exclude=PAT
      When recursing, skip subdirectories or files matching PAT.
      For example, 'du --exclude='*.o'' excludes files whose names end in '.o'.

   -X FILE
   --exclude-from=FILE
      Like '--exclude', except take the patterns to exclude from FILE, one per line.
       If FILE is '-', take the patterns from standard input.
On BSD systems, 'du' reports sizes that are half the correct values for files that are NFS-mounted from HP-UX systems. On HP-UX systems, it reports sizes that are twice the correct values for files that are NFS-mounted from BSD systems. This is due to a flaw in HP-UX; it also affects the HP-UX 'du' program.


Examples

image001
As shown above du displayed the disk space used by the corresponding files. Now, the displayed values are actually in the units of the first available SIZE from – -block-size, and the DU_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE and BLOCKSIZE environment variables and if not in this format then units are default to 1024 bytes (or 512 if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set). Don’t get puzzled from the above paragraph. We can simply use -h option to force du to produce the output in the human readable format.
