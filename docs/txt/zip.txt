Zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix. Each file is stored in a single .zip {.zip-filename} file with the extension .zip.
Zip is used to compress files to reduce file size and is also used as a file package utility. Zip is available in many operating systems like Unix, Linux, windows, etc.
If you have limited bandwidth between two servers and want to transfer the files faster, then zip the files and transfer them.
The zip program puts one or more compressed files into a single zip archive, along with information about the files (name, path, date, time of last modification, protection, and check information to verify file integrity). An entire directory structure can be packed into a zip archive with a single command.
Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 is common for text files. zip has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without compression. zip automatically chooses the better of the two for each file to be compressed. The program is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution, archiving files, and for saving disk space by temporarily compressing unused files or directories.
<s1>Syntax:</s1>
zip [options] [file_name.zip] [files_names]
The syntax for Creating a zip file:
zip [file_name.zip] [file_name]
<s1>Example:</s1>
Suppose we have a zip file “name = jayesh_gfg.zip” and we have three text files inside it “name = a.txt, b.txt and c.txt”. we have to unzip it in the current directory.
Syntax and Output:
unzip jayesh_gfg.zip

zip -m myfile.zip *.c
<img src="img/zip (2).png" alt="Description of zip">


zip -r myfile.zip . -x  a.txt
Here, the -r option is used to recursively add all files and directories in the current directory to the archive, and the. specifies the current directory as the source directory. The -x a.txt option excludes the file “a.txt” from the archive.
To check files inside “myfile.zip” we can type “vi myfile.zip”.
