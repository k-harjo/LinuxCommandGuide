local - Create variables


SYNTAX

      local [option] name[=value]
For each argument, a local variable named name is created, and assigned value.

The option can be any of the options accepted by declare.

local can only be used within a function; it makes the variable name have a visible scope restricted to that function and its children.

The return status is zero unless local is used outside a function, an invalid name is supplied, or name is a readonly variable.

This is a BASH shell builtin, to display your local syntax from the bash prompt type: help local
